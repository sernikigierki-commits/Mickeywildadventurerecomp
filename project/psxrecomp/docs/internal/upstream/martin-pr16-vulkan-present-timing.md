## Included scope

Extends the existing `vk_perf` ring with a presentation timestamp and microsecond durations for queue-idle waits, swapchain acquisition, and queue presentation. The JSON debug-server response exposes all four fields for frame-pacing diagnosis.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Command-buffer batching, staging reuse, and present-mode policy are isolated on separate branches.
- The earlier environment-gated VRAM dump/verification diagnostics are excluded.
- CRT presentation and game-specific benchmark commentary are excluded.

The source commit has no secondary co-author trailer; only Martin Penkava is credited in the local commit trailer.

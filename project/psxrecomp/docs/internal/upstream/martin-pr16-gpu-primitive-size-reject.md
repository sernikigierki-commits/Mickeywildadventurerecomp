The 1023-pixel horizontal and 511-pixel vertical limits are PS1 hardware rules
documented by No$PSX and implemented by independent emulators including Beetle
and DuckStation. The framework checks parsed coordinates before widescreen and
draw-offset transforms. Every flat, shaded, textured, and shaded-textured
polygon path is covered; quads reject each rendered triangle independently.
Mono/shaded lines and both polyline continuations use the same limits. Textured
commands still latch their texture-page state before a size rejection.

The source commit's game name and observed scenes are validation evidence only;

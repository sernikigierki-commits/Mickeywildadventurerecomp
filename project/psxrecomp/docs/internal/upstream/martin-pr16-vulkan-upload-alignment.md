## Included scope

Packed CPU-to-GPU upload regions are padded to an even texel count so every R16 `VkBufferImageCopy.bufferOffset` remains four-byte aligned. The copied image extents are unchanged.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Vulkan render-pass and acquire-semaphore synchronization are isolated on separate branches.
- All `PSX_VK_*` WIP diagnostics from the source commit are excluded.
- CRT shaders, presentation redesign, game-specific data, and scripts are excluded.

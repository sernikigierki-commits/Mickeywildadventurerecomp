The fallback handles executable RAM populated by bulk host transfers that do
not traverse ordinary RAM write hooks. A control transfer above the configured
boot-EXE text end is admitted only when its first word passes the existing MIPS
decoder check; the interpreter then marks that word executable. Invalid, data,
out-of-RAM, and below-floor targets remain rejected.

The source commit also added pre-initialization guards to the overlay loader.
Those guards were reviewed and merged separately in PR #23 and are explicitly
excluded here. The source commit's game name, disc ID, addresses, and validation
claims are evidence only and are not embedded in framework code.

## Included scope

- The 512-entry PS1 SPU Gaussian coefficient table introduced by the source commit.
- Four-tap hardware Gaussian interpolation of decoded ADPCM voice samples.
- Preservation of the preceding ADPCM block's final three samples so interpolation remains continuous at block boundaries.
- A standalone regression test covering the boundary-history tap order and the equivalent in-block window.

## Deliberate exclusions

- The reverb engine and reverb register handling from the same source commit are isolated on a different branch.
- The source commit's high-quality shadow/reverb gating is not needed for the dry Gaussian path and is excluded.
- No game-specific addresses, generated code, configuration, or scripts are included.

## Provenance note

The source header identifies the coefficient values as the documented PS1 hardware table from No$PSX documentation and DuckStation's `core/spu.cpp`. The values are hardware data; this branch preserves Martin Penkava's implementation provenance and exact authorship trailers. No DuckStation implementation code was imported here.

## Included scope

The tear-free Vulkan policy prefers MAILBOX because PSXRecomp's frontend already paces frames. If MAILBOX is unavailable, Vulkan's required FIFO mode remains the fallback; the explicit tearing policy still requests IMMEDIATE.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Source-commit benchmark comments naming a particular game are omitted; the policy itself is title-independent.
- Command-buffer batching and staging reuse are isolated on separate branches.
- Timing diagnostics, CRT presentation, and game-specific data are excluded.

The source commit has no secondary co-author trailer; only Martin Penkava is credited in the local commit trailer.

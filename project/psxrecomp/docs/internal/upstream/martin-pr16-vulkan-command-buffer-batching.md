## Included scope

Records the backend's small logical work operations into one open Vulkan command buffer and submits that buffer at the existing GPU synchronization point. This removes hundreds of per-operation command-buffer submissions while retaining command recording order and existing image barriers.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Persistent staging allocation reuse and present-mode policy are isolated on separate branches.
- Present timing telemetry and the earlier `PSX_VK_*` WIP diagnostics are excluded.
- CRT shaders, CRT pipeline objects, screen-kind routing, and game-specific data are excluded.

The source commit has no secondary co-author trailer; only Martin Penkava is credited in the local commit trailer.

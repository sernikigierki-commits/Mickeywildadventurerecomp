## Included scope

Adds an explicit color-attachment memory dependency between back-to-back geometry, wide-surface, and wide-clear render passes when the image remains in `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`. This mirrors the existing depth/stencil ordering and covers drivers that do not tolerate the missing external dependency.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Packed upload alignment and swapchain acquire synchronization are isolated on separate branches.
- All `PSX_VK_*` WIP diagnostics from the source commit are excluded.
- CRT shaders and the later presentation redesign are excluded.

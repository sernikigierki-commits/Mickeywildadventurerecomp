## Included

Only the overlay-loader lifecycle guards from the source commit were adapted.
`overlay_loader_dispatch()`, `overlay_loader_is_candidate()`, and
`overlay_loader_call_native()` now return without consulting overlay indexes
until `overlay_loader_init()` finishes constructing them and sets `s_active`.

The focused regression test is
`runtime/tests/test_overlay_init_guard.py`.

## Explicitly excluded

- The source commit's decodable-word/high-RAM dirty-interpreter fallback in
  `runtime/src/dirty_ram_interp.c`.
- All SmackDown-specific behavior and data.
- Every other PR #16 change, including Vulkan, audio/SPU, GPU primitive-size,
  MSVC portability, and helper-script work.

The source commit combined the lifecycle guard with a separate discovery
fallback. This port intentionally does not cherry-pick that commit; it adapts
only the three fail-closed `s_active` checks so the framework change remains
game-agnostic and reviewable in isolation.

## Included scope

Adds Vulkan to the launcher's renderer cycle and label. The runtime already recognizes renderer value `2` as Vulkan; this exposes that existing backend through the graphical launcher while keeping OpenGL-only controls gated to renderer value `1`.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Vulkan backend correctness/performance changes are isolated on their own branches.
- CRT presentation, diagnostics, and game-specific data are excluded.

The source commit has no secondary co-author trailer; only Martin Penkava is credited in the local commit trailer.

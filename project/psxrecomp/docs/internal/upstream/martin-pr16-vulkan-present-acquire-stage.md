## Included scope

The swapchain acquire semaphore is waited at the transfer stage as well as color-attachment output. The presentation command buffer performs transfer clears/blits, so those writes must be ordered after acquisition on strict drivers.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Packed upload alignment and render-pass color self-barriers are isolated on separate branches.
- All `PSX_VK_*` WIP diagnostics from the source commit are excluded.
- CRT shaders and the later presentation redesign are excluded.

# Faithful Timing Core — Game Plan (psxrecomp)

**READ THIS EACH SESSION.** Referenced from CLAUDE.md Rule -1 and from the
auto-memory ([[psxrecomp-build-faithful-core-not-hacks]],
[[precise_irq_slice_state]]). This is the authoritative plan; update the
"Status / Log" section every session.

---

## 0. North star + guardrails (non-negotiable)

Build the **faithful hardware-timing core** of the static recompiler. The PSX
recompiler is being BUILT, not preserved:

- The correct fix is ALWAYS the faithful, class-level core — NEVER a surgical
  per-game patch, symptom workaround, `game.toml` hack, or "make native agree
  with interp even if both are fake."
- Breaking other titles is acceptable; they were built on a faulty ecosystem and
  will be **regenerated**. Backward-compat is NOT a constraint.
- No stubs, no HLE, no interpreter-as-fallback (Architecture A locked). Fix the
  recompiler/runtime and regenerate; never edit `generated/*.c`.
- Don't guess (PRINCIPLES). Confirm every mechanism with the oracle + rings
  BEFORE changing code. Build observability first.
- Confer with ChatGPT via the **Chrome MCP browser at chatgpt.com** — the
  existing "PSX Static Recompiler Debug" chat (the user has Plus logged in).
  NOT the `codex` CLI (usage-limited).

## 1. The problem (diagnosis, confirmed)

A static recompiler charges cycles **block-granular** (instruction count up front
at each block leader) and checks IRQs at **block edges**. Real HW and the
sanctioned dirty-RAM interpreter have a **per-instruction** cycle timeline and
take IRQs at the exact instruction. Games that read timers / poll IRQ-driven
flags in tight loops fork between backends.

Tomba 2 (SCUS-94454) logo→FMV stall is the canonical case. The cascade:
1. Timer1 debounce value-fork @ pc 0x8008592C (frame 1823) — fixed by exact block
   cycle costs ("Fix A", already in tree).
2. **CURRENT BLOCKER:** measured **−8 cycle drift** (native BEHIND interp),
   entering in the BIOS→overlay init transition (func 0x80050B0C subtree). The
   frame-1824 logo-delay wait loop (caller 0x8008AE48 → RCnt reader 0x80085900;
   exits when *0x80102748[=960] < elapsed Timer1) loops ~1557× in interp (reaches
   FMV) vs ~42× native (stuck on logo).
   **Mechanism (located in code_generator.cpp):** when a branch's delay slot is
   ALSO a block leader (`exit_has_delay && !delay_slot_in_block`, ~line 1243), the
   branch block's `instruction_count` excludes the delay slot; on the TAKEN path
   the delay-slot clone runs but its cycle is charged by neither the branch block
   nor the (unentered) delay-slot block → undercount 1/site. ~8 sites = −8.
3. Interrupt take-point granularity (block-edge vs exact instruction) — the
   "precise IRQ slicing" track. PARKED (default off); it is a later correctness
   upgrade, NOT the FMV blocker. Validated design exists (block-leader
   continuations); see §5.

## 2. The target architecture (what "faithful core" means)

Per ChatGPT (validated) + standard practice:
- ONE shared **per-instruction cycle-cost function** `psx_instr_base_cycles(pc,
  insn)` used by BOTH the dirty-interp and the recompiler. No two approximate
  models.
- Recompiler emits **exact** accumulated cycle charges (collapses to a constant
  per pure-compute block); every dynamically executed instruction charged exactly
  once; delay slots owned by the branch bundle.
- **Segmented charge** before any guest-visible time observation (MMIO read/write
  to timers/GPUSTAT/SPUSTAT/DMA/CD/I_STAT/I_MASK, BIOS/device calls, backedges,
  calls/returns) so native and interp observe devices at the same architectural
  boundary.
- **Timers derived on-demand** from a global guest-cycle counter at read time;
  DMA/CD/GPU/IRQ on **scheduled event deadlines** (not per-cycle ticking) so
  compiled stays fast.
- Invariant: *every execution backend may differ in host implementation, but not
  in guest-visible time.* At same-PC convergence points, native cycle total ==
  interp cycle total.
- pc=0 means ONLY a real guest pc=0 / explicit termination — NEVER "dispatcher
  couldn't re-enter." Fail closed + log on undispatchable PCs.

## 3. Phased plan (each phase: confirm → build → regen → run → measure → screenshot)

- **P1 — Cycle-audit observability.** Add a per-function/at-convergence cycle
  audit: record native vs interp cumulative guest cycles at same-PC points; expose
  via TCP/ring. SUCCESS: reproduces the flat −8 and pinpoints the entering site(s).
- **P2 — Delay-slot cycle ownership (the −8).** Fix in code_generator.cpp: branch
  bundle charges its delay slot; not-taken fallthrough → branch_pc+8 (not the
  delay-slot leader); delay-slot-as-standalone-leader charges itself; no
  double-count on the not-taken path. SUCCESS: audit shows −8 → 0; Tomba 2 reaches
  the intro FMV (screenshot). Likely the FMV unblock.
- **P3 — Shared per-instruction cost function.** Single `psx_instr_base_cycles`
  consumed by both backends; recompiler emits exact accumulated charges with
  MMIO/boundary segmentation. SUCCESS: first-divergence hashes identical past frame
  1824 across a longer run; audit stays 0.
- **P4 — On-demand timers + event deadlines.** Timer1/2/0 computed from global
  cycle counter at read; devices on scheduled deadlines. SUCCESS: no perf
  regression; timing-sensitive paths stable.
- **P5 — Precise take-points (fold in parked work).** Re-enable slicing; emit
  EVERY block leader as a CPS continuation (global dispatch → owning func w/
  cpu->pc; never a new entry; fail-closed on undispatchable). SUCCESS: exact-
  instruction IRQ delivery with bounded (one-block) hand-back.
- **P6 — Regression + faithfulness.** Regen + screenshot-smoke ALL titles (BIOS,
  Tomba 1, MMX6, Ape, Tomba 2); delete Tomba2 `overlay_native_block` (must still
  reach FMV/title); calibrate the shared model against Beetle/psx-spx. Pin bump is
  user-gated.

## 3b. Cycle-cost model SOURCE (no clean-room needed — transcribe + verify)

The HW-intended cycle model is documented AND available as reference source we
already have in-tree (our oracle's own code). Stage-2 = transcribe the NUMBERS
(facts, not GPL-protected expression; also in psx-spx) into OUR shared cost
function, then VERIFY each against Beetle at runtime. Do NOT paste Beetle code
(architecture differs + GPLv2 hygiene); write our own informed by the facts.

Extraction map — `psxrecomp/beetle-psx/mednafen/psx/` (main checkout):
- **CPU base / instruction fetch:** cpu.cpp `ReadInstruction()` (~L534) — icache
  model: `timestamp += 4` cache-disabled (0xA000_0000+), `+3` on cache miss/fill,
  `+1` per fill word, near-0 on hit. For a static recompiler this becomes a
  per-block fetch-cost constant (assume cache-enabled steady state; calibrate).
- **Memory wait-states:** cpu.cpp `ReadMemory()` (~L365) / `WriteMemory()` (~L454)
  — `timestamp += (ReadFudge>>4)&2`, the `lts` delta from `PSX_MemRead*` is the
  region wait-state; `LDAbsorb = lts - timestamp` is the load-delay absorb. Charge
  in OUR psx_read/write path by region (RAM fast, BIOS ROM slow, scratchpad fast,
  MMIO per-device). Split clean from CPU base (don't double-count).
- **Mult/Div latency:** cpu.cpp `MULT_Tab24` (~L101), `muldiv_ts_done` (~L154) —
  mult/div set a completion timestamp; a later MFHI/MFLO stalls until then. Model
  as a documented latency (mult ~6-13 by operand magnitude via MULT_Tab; div/divu
  ~36). Encode as instruction cost + optional stall-on-read.
- **GTE/COP2 per-command cycles:** gte.cpp `GTE_Instruction()` (L1713) returns the
  count via each op fn (DPCS/MVMVA/NCDS/…). Well-known table (also psx-spx):
  RTPS=15 RTPT=23 MVMVA=8 SQR=5 OP=6 AVSZ3=5 AVSZ4=6 NCLIP=8 NCDS=19 NCDT=44
  NCCS=17 NCCT=39 NCS=14 NCT=30 CC=11 CCS? CDP=13 DPCS=8 DPCT=17 DCPL=8 INTPL=8
  GPF=5 GPL=5 (verify each against gte.cpp op-fn returns + psx-spx before use).
- **Timers (already partly faithful):** timer.cpp — divider ratios already used
  (T1 hblank ÷2146 etc.); move to on-demand counter = f(global cycles) at read.

Build order for the model (P3 → Stage-2):
1. Shared header (single source of truth) consumed by interp (runtime) AND
   recompiler (it already includes ../../runtime/include/*.h): identity first
   (cost=1) → regen → prove byte-identical generated cycle charges (zero behaviour
   change) → seam established.
2. Fill real costs from the extraction map, ONE component at a time, each verified
   against Beetle at runtime (native cumulative cycles == Beetle at convergence).
3. Memory wait-states in the psx_read/write path (region table).
DO each transcription with the Beetle source open + a runtime cross-check; a wrong
cycle number CREATES divergence, so verify, don't rush.

## 3c. STAGE 2 — full hardware cycle accuracy (the goal; -8 is DONE/past)

The -8 was backend-disagreement (native vs our interp); FIXED (FMV reached). Stage 2
makes the cycle model match REAL R3000A timing, validated against Beetle. We are NOT
hardware-cycle-accurate yet: model is ~1 cycle/instruction; Beetle charges ~2x.

### The validation breakthrough: DELTA comparison (offset-independent)
Absolute-cycle comparison through boot is meaningless (native is ~121M cycles off
Beetle due to turbo-loads/overlay load-model differences). BUT the cyc_watch
comparator's per-hit DELTAS cancel that offset: between two consecutive hits of the
same anchor (one iteration of identical code), native charged 46 cycles vs Beetle 91
(@0x80017FC4). That ~2x gap IS the cycle-model inaccuracy, measured cleanly. So:
  VALIDATE STAGE 2 BY MATCHING native Δcycles == Beetle Δcycles over identical
  regions (consecutive same-anchor hits, or entry/exit anchor pairs), NOT absolute.
First concrete target: make the 0x80017FC4 inter-hit Δ 46 -> 91 (== Beetle).

### Stage-2 progress log
- #1a data-load cost DONE (2ef47bd): psx_instr_base_cycles +2 per CPU load (LWC2 +1).
  Δ gate @0x80017FC4: native per-iter 46 -> 56 (Beetle 91). FMV still streams (no
  regression). Closed ~10/45. Approximation: no scratchpad-free / region / load-delay
  ABSORB yet — those are refinements (absorb would LOWER native, so it's not the
  remaining 35; the remaining gap is other components below).
- REMAINING ~35 cyc: DISASSEMBLED func_80017FC4 — it is only loads/stores/ALU/branches
  + a countdown delay loop; NO mult/div/GTE/MMIO. So the gap is NOT those, for this fn.
  BUT func_80017FC4 exits via a CPS TAIL-CALL to 0x8001EFFC (no normal return), so the
  single-anchor entry-to-next-entry window SPANS MULTIPLE functions (80017FC4 ->
  8001EFFC -> ... -> re-call). => single-anchor Δ is TOO COARSE for per-component
  attribution; the 56/91 covers code we haven't disassembled.
- TOOLING NEXT (before more cost components): add a TWO-ANCHOR region mode to cyc_watch
  (capture cycles at region START anchor A and END anchor B; report Δ(B−A) per pass) on
  BOTH backends. Then validate the cost model on a KNOWN, fully-disassembled single
  code path (no calls/loops crossing out) — e.g. a leaf function entry→its terminator.
  That gives rigorous per-component attribution instead of an opaque multi-fn window.
  Only then resume adding components (fetch / mult-div-stall / GTE / load-absorb).

### Components to transcribe (from in-tree Beetle + psx-spx; verify each by Δ)
The ~2x gap is dominated by what 1/insn ignores. Implement one at a time, re-measure Δ:
1. **Memory access wait-states (biggest lever).** Real loads/stores cost >1 cycle by
   region (RAM/BIOS-ROM/scratchpad/MMIO). Beetle: cpu.cpp ReadMemory `lts` delta +
   LDAbsorb (load-delay). Charge in the load/store path: interp exec_one's mem ops AND
   the recompiler-emitted cpu->read/write (or a per-load/store charge). Region table.
2. **Instruction fetch / I-cache timing.** Beetle ReadInstruction (+1 hit / +fill on
   miss). For the recompiler, fold a per-block fetch-cost constant.
3. **Mult/Div latency.** Beetle MULT_Tab/muldiv_ts_done: mult ~6-13, div ~36, stall on
   HI/LO read. Encode in psx_instr_base_cycles (+ optional stall-on-read).
4. **GTE/COP2 per-command.** Beetle gte.cpp GTE_Instruction table (RTPS=15, NCDS=19,
   NCDT=44, ...). Encode in psx_instr_base_cycles for COP2 ops.
All land in the single-source psx_instr_base_cycles (opcode costs) + a memory-path
wait-state charger (address-dependent). Both backends consume the same model (seam
already in place). Each component: transcribe -> regen/build -> Δ-compare vs Beetle
on a fixed region -> next.

### Caveats
- Δ-region must be IDENTICAL code on both (a tight loop body, or a pure-compute
  function). Avoid regions that cross turbo-load / overlay / dirty boundaries.
- Relocated BIOS-shell funcs (phys 0x30000-0x5AFFF) dispatch at a different native
  phys — anchor on game-text / BIOS-ROM, or the relocated phys.
- This is a multi-component effort; do it methodically, one validated component at a
  time. The comparator (cyc_watch + cycle_compare.py) is the validation backbone.

## 4. Tooling / oracle
- Runtime TCP port 4500; Beetle oracle 4382. Always-on rings: `event_ring`,
  `wtrace_all` (write trace; `newest=1`). `freeze_check` has slice-trace + cycle
  fields. `PSX_EXIT_HALT=1` halts-and-serves at the pc=0 exit for post-mortem.
- Build runtime: `cmake --build Tomba2Recomp/build-t2 --target psx-runtime`
  (PATH=/c/msys64/mingw64/bin). Recompiler: `cmake --build
  _wt-tomba2/psxrecomp/recompiler/build-t2 --target psxrecomp-game`. Regen:
  `recompiler/build-t2/psxrecomp-game.exe --config game.toml` (rebuild tool first).
- Reference: nocash psx-spx; the dirty-RAM interp is the in-process oracle for
  compiled code; Beetle is the HW oracle.

## 5. Status / Log (update every session)

- **2026-08-31 (GPU DMA2 review correction — source gate passed):**
  The first fork review found two valid timing defects in the DMA2 candidate. The
  linked-list engine now reads and emits one live payload word at each
  one-clock boundary. A CPU rewrite after an earlier word transfers can now
  affect a later word. The optional widescreen prepass now fingerprints its
  cached nodes and commands. It discards all cached transform metadata if live
  RAM differs. The second fork review found three more valid issues. Late
  service now consumes every elapsed DMA boundary. Header and link rewrites
  now invalidate cached prepass topology at the exact header-read boundary.
  The obsolete opt-in polygon-drop filter was removed. The focused regressions
  and full build pass. The runtime suite passes 61 of 62 enabled tests. The
  remaining `mod_runtime_test` crash reproduces on the unchanged upstream base,
  and two pre-existing tests remain disabled. Fresh Spot and Vampire Hunter D
  builds also pass their
  600-frame headless gates. Visible software-renderer routes and another fork
  review are still required before the public branch can change.

- **2026-07-28 (per-game host audio cushion — implemented, parser validated):**
  Added `[audio] buffer_ms` as a runtime-only developer setting with a guarded
  30–500 ms range. The compatibility default remains 180 ms, preserving the
  reserve required by titles with long streamed-stage production gaps; a game
  may opt into a lower target after validation to reduce audible latency.
  `audio_stats` and the opt-in runtime cadence report now expose both actual
  fill and configured target. This changes only the host playback bridge and
  does not alter guest SPU state, instruction timing, or code generation.
  Recompiler build and all 33 registered tests pass.

- **2026-07-27 (BIOS boot-skip parity across BIOS images — FIXED, validated):**
  `bios_hle`'s boot-skip did nothing under the bundled OpenBIOS. Root cause was
  ordering, not policy: `main.cpp` correctly forced the *kernel-call* tier off
  when an image exports no `deliver_event_ret`, by assigning `bios_hle = false`,
  and then derived `boot_skip` from that already-mutated flag. OpenBIOS omits
  `deliver_event_ret` (B0 semantics unvalidated) but DOES export
  `shell_entry_phys`, so the skip was structurally available and got cancelled
  anyway — one player-facing flag meaning two different things depending on a
  BIOS detail no player can see. Enhancement-phase (load-time) defect; no
  timing-core change.
  Fix: the two axes are now decided by one pure, dependency-free function,
  `psx_bios_hle_plan()` (`runtime/src/bios_hle_plan.c`), which reads the
  REQUESTED `bios_hle` for the boot decision and gates each axis on only the
  anchor it actually needs; refusals are reported at startup instead of silently
  downgrading. `psx_bios_hle_configure()` additionally clamps `boot_skip` to
  `shell_entry_phys != 0` so the banner and `hle_dump` cannot overstate what can
  fire. New `bios_hle_plan_test` (16/16 runtime ctest green) pins the matrix,
  including an exhaustive 64-case sweep asserting the boot decision is
  independent of `deliver_event_ret` and the call decision independent of
  `shell_entry_phys`.
  Validated on Ape Escape (SCUS-94423) built against this framework, both BIOS
  backends linked, headless: OpenBIOS → `bios_boot=skip to game (shell
  skipped)`, `hle_dump route=2` shows the one-shot fire at `vec 0x30000`,
  `ra=0xBFC06EA8` (the exact continuation `bios/OpenBIOS.toml` documents),
  game running on screen. Retail SCPH-1001 → same banner, same `vec 0x30000`
  fire at `ra=0xBFC0702C`, game running; differs only in
  `bios_backend=HLE (LLE fallback)` vs `LLE (recompiled BIOS)`. Negative control
  `PSX_BIOS_HLE=0` on OpenBIOS → `bios_boot=real intro`, ring total 0 (hook not
  installed), display 640x478 shell mode: the flag still turns the skip off.
  Also in this pass: a BIOS profile's `[runtime]` block was parsed into
  `BiosConfig::runtime` and read by NOTHING, and `bios/OpenBIOS.toml` carried an
  inert `bios_hle = false` there that read as the reason HLE was off.
  `load_bios_config` now REJECTS `[runtime]` in a BIOS profile. And
  `psx_icache_fastpath_test` had been unbuildable ("redefinition of
  `psx_advance_cycles`" — the test's counting stub vs the header's `static
  inline`), which blocked every runtime test registered after it; it now builds
  with `PSX_OVERLAY_DLL_BUILD=1`, the seam `psx_cycles.h` already provides.

- **2026-07-21 (VLC load-charge batching — shipped; dual still ~22 ms):**
  Runtime-only batch: under `psx_next_service_cycle`, `psx_cyc_charge`
  accumulates into `g_psx_cyc_batch` (no per-insn `psx_cycle_count` store);
  flush at IRQ check / MMIO sync / savestate / advance-past-deadline.
  Absorb/fudge still per-insn; guest totals at barriers unchanged; no MotK
  regen. Dual headless MotK (`PSX_NETPLAY_TIMING=1`, pinned halves): heavy
  25–50 band host med ≈39.7 fps / guest ≈21.9 ms/f / admit ≈3.1 (guest peer
  ≈39.8 / 22.5 / 2.8) — same floor as pre-batch (~21 ms / ~40–42). Counter
  publish was not the dual-peer tax; residual remains load-delay volume /
  LLC under phase-locked VLC. Next: PGO retrain after hot-path edits, or
  accept same-machine lockstep FMV floor.
- **2026-07-21 (MotK FMV host cost — MDEC/IRQ/charge; dual still ~21 ms):**
  Aimed to cut MotK FMV host work so two lockstep peers fit ~16.7 ms/f.
  Shipped bit-exact host opts: MDEC MB output reserve (no per-byte
  ensure_capacity), sparse-column IDCT, ch0 DMA burst feed
  (`mdec_dma_write_words`), sticky-IRQ undeliverable early-out in
  `psx_check_interrupts`, `psx_cyc_charge` pre-deadline bump on compiled
  loads/steps. Dual headless MotK (`PSX_NETPLAY_TIMING=1`, pinned halves):
  band 25–50 fps still guest ≈21 ms/f / fps ≈40–42 (admit ≈2.5–3) — same
  floor as before. HARD_CAP 16K→64K tried, no gain (real CD/timer events
  already shorten the deadline); reverted. Residual is phase-locked dual
  VLC load-delay volume / LLC contention, not MDEC FIFO or present/admit.
  Next: emitter-level load-charge batching for VLC leaves, PGO retrain
  after these hot-path edits, or accept same-machine lockstep FMV floor.
- **2026-07-21 (netplay FMV — lockstep guest inflation, not present/admit):**
  User A/B: two windowed offline MotK intros fine; headless netplay FMV still
  slow vs offline headless. Opt-in `PSX_NETPLAY_TIMING=1` splits the [FPS]
  line into guest ms/f vs admit ms/f. Heavy FMV (~25–50 fps samples): guest
  ≈21 ms/f, admit ≈3 ms/f (median) — frame time is dominated by the guest
  quantum under phase-locked dual MDEC, not Swap and not INPUT_CONFIRM wait.
  Offline headless same stretch is ~17 ms/f (≈57 fps). Pipelined CONFIRM
  tried in recomp-net (tip publish, drain next tick) — no FPS gain on
  localhost (~41→~41.5); reverted. Present-path / half-rate work is a dead
  end for this regression. Next lever: reduce MotK FMV host cost so two
  aligned peers fit a 16.7 ms budget (or accept same-machine lockstep floor).
- **2026-07-21 (netplay FMV — restore present-before-admit):**
  User confirmed early same-machine netplay FMV was ~50–60 and gameplay
  under lockstep stays ~60 — so the rematch-safe `finish→admit→pace→present`
  order was the FMV regression (expensive depth24 CPU present after admit).
  Restored `finish→present→admit/pace` via RAII `NetplayVblankTail` (admit
  on every return path; offline still paces before present). Kept half-rate
  depth24 present skip + UDP `poll()` barrier; no `SDL_Delay(0)`. Verify
  MotK intro FPS + tick-0 arm after rebuild.
- **2026-07-21 (netplay FMV — re-land half-rate depth24 present):**
  Windowed same-machine MotK netplay FMV was back at ~30–40 after the
  rematch-safe `finish→admit→pace→present` order. Re-landed host-only
  half-rate depth24 present: after admit, skip pace+Swap every other
  depth24 vblank (present first, then alternate); admit/barrier unchanged
  (no `SDL_Delay(0)` / present-before-admit). Offline path untouched.
  Rebuild MotK `build-release` + verify intro FPS and tick-0 arm.
- **2026-07-21 (lobby game_version + release pins):**
  WS lobby now carries `game_version` alongside `game_name` (create/list/join).
  Server rejects `version_mismatch` / `game_mismatch`; list can filter by either.
  MotK/MW bake release pins from repo `VERSION` (Release → e.g. `0.1.0`, else
  `dev`) via `PSX_GAME_VERSION` / `SNESRECOMP_BUILD_VERSION`. Clients send the
  pin on create/join and filter the lobby browser. Redeploy lobby server for
  remote matchmaking. Docs: `recomp-net-server/docs/WS_LOBBY.md`.
- **2026-07-21 (portable .pst / boot_state v3 LE wire):**
  Savestate / boot_state version → 3: header + section framing and all
  module snapshots emit little-endian field wires (`pst_wire.h`) — no
  host-struct padding (TimerRegs, DMA async/delayed, SpuVoice, McSlotState,
  CDROM Pending/Queued). Netplay host→guest blob transfer is identical on
  Win/Linux x86_64 and macOS ARM. Old v2 `.pst` files are rejected (recapture).

- **2026-07-20 (netplay match_caps — host settings enforce):**
  Lobby `create` / `set_match_caps` / `start` carry host sim caps
  (aspect, turbo_loads, bios_hle, fast_boot, auto_skip_fmv, input_delay,
  language). Server echoes on join/update/launch; guests apply before boot.
  recomp-net-server + psx_lobby_client + MotK launcher. SNES mirror:
  widescreen/hud/ignore_aspect/input_delay/ws_extra via snes_lobby + MW main.

- **2026-07-20 (launcher: persist controller selection immediately):**
  Device/mode/deadzone now write `settings.toml` on change (not only Launch),
  so Refresh / Quit / soft-return keep the pad. Refresh falls back to saved
  GUID if the dropdown index is stale.

- **2026-07-20 (lobby default → public host):**
  `psx_lobby_default_url` now `ws://netplay.retcomm.net:8765`
  (match SNES); override still `PSX_NET_LOBBY_URL`. Synced MotK vendored
  `psx_lobby_client.{c,h}` + recomp-net `docs/lobby.md`.

- **2026-07-20 (Metal Warriors H2H: top-edge prop pop):**
  Full-frame present recenters dual cam ~$40 up; spawn/OAM top was only
  −$70/−$70 so platforms popped at Y=0. Spawn −$A8, OAM CMP −144, present
  Y wrap peek for −64..0, dist-limit +64 when vert-widen.

- **2026-07-20 (launcher: controller Refresh rescan):**
  Dashboard Device row (P1 + offline P2) has Refresh — pumps SDL joysticks,
  re-enumerates gamecontrollers, keeps selection by GUID. Offline + netplay.

- **2026-07-20 (launcher: lobby lock emoji via symbol fallback font):**
  Password lobbies showed □ for 🔒 because the primary face has no emoji.
  Load a symbol fallback face through the shared Dear ImGui font atlas so
  missing glyphs resolve.

- **2026-07-20 (launcher lobbies: button order + dblclick join):**
  Lobbies actions: Return to Launcher → Change Player Name → Host Game →
  Join Lobby. Double-click a lobby row joins (same path as Join Lobby,
  including password modal).

- **2026-07-20 (launcher: offline↔netplay switch buttons):**
  Dashboard footer: "Switch to Netplay" beside Launch Game (only when
  `PSX_HAS_RECOMP_NET`); "Switch to Offline" beside Netplay Lobbies.
  Home Netplay tile gated the same way; no-netplay builds skip home chooser.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay load — apply freeze after hash match):**
  Suppressing INPUT at `np_begin_load_apply` deadlocked both peers in
  `netplay_barrier_admit`: tips stopped → `try_admit` never succeeded →
  guest never ran → `savestate_poll` never applied. Fix: keep INPUT during
  APPLYING; suppress only at `np_enter_load_ready` until `hard_resync`+prime.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay load — false peer_disconnect → lobby):**
  Hash-match apply suppresses INPUT for seconds → `peer_disconnected(1500)`
  fired → soft-exit to lobby → rematch. Fix: timeout=0 (BYE-only) while
  `in_load_barrier`; HELLO keepalive every 250 ms during suppress/stall.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay post-load — stale INPUT clobber):**
  2nd+ loads: correct frame, then ~3–5s frozen while FPS lived. Cause: during
  LOAD apply/ready the slower peer kept emitting pre-resync INPUT tips; those
  ticks share ring slots with the new tip (`tick % 128`) and first-wins /
  overwrite races blocked `remotes_ready_for_sim` after `hard_resync`. Fix:
  suppress INPUT sends for the load barrier; reject out-of-window remote ticks;
  host `probe_finish` before sync+prime; re-anchor frame pacer on restore.

- **2026-07-20 (savestate load — force GL present after identical frame):**
  2nd+ load of the same `.pst` left FPS climbing while the picture stayed
  frozen: `gl_renderer_present_vram` / wide early-out skipped `SwapWindow`
  when display rect + present-dirty matched the last swap (common after
  restoring into an already-shown frame). Fix: `gl_renderer_invalidate_present`
  marks all present tiles dirty, clears path latches, resets interp history,
  and forces 8 presents; called from `psx_frontend_on_savestate_loaded`.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay post-load — admit barrier symmetric):**
  Host dropped `LOAD_READY` before `try_admit` (guest did not) → confirm
  wait with barrier already down; keeping remotes let stale tip=D
  first-wins. Fix: both stay in `LOAD_READY` until admit; `hard_resync`
  clears remotes again; sync+prime at mutual ready only.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay post-load — mutual-ready sync):**
  `hard_resync`+prime at apply let the later peer wipe the earlier tip
  (2nd load slower). Sync once at mutual ready. (Remote-keep reverted —
  see admit-barrier note above.)

- **2026-07-20 (netplay post-load — symmetric ready release):**
  Guest cleared `LOAD_READY` on READY ACK while host still had
  `state_stall_sim` → confirm wait / intermittent hitch. Guest now ACKs
  but stays in `LOAD_READY` until `try_admit` succeeds (pre-sends
  INPUT_CONFIRM so host can admit on the same poll as `probe_finish`).
  Ready-probe retransmit 40→8 ms; confirm retransmit 16→4 ms. MotK rebuild.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay post-load resume — frozen picture + FPS):**
  After load, FPS kept climbing while the window stayed on a stale/blank
  frame: (1) present blank-latch skipped redraw after restore; (2) delay
  rings empty after `hard_resync` while peers could still advance during
  APPLYING. Fix: `hard_resync` resets `sim_tick→0` + `prime_delay_inputs`;
  stall admit for APPLYING when `!savestate_pending` and all LOAD_READY;
  `psx_frontend_on_savestate_loaded` forces restage/blank once; skip FPS
  CLI during load barrier. MotK rebuild.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay host-only save/load commands):**
  User `savestate_request_*` refused on netplay guest; F-keys / debug TCP /
  `PSX_LOAD_SLOT` host-only or routed via `psx_netplay_request_*`. Guest
  follow-host sync uses `savestate_request_*_protocol`.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay load — post-restore lockstep rendezvous):**
  Hash-match load applied on each peer at different times after early
  `hard_resync` → rings/ticks drifted → admit hang / starvation. Fix:
  stage load → apply while admit runs → `hard_resync` only after restore →
  LOAD size=0 ready probe until both ACK → then resume. Heartbeat in
  admit barrier. MotK rebuild.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay save hang — coord probe must not stall):**
  Shift+F1 stalled admit before `savestate_poll` could write → deadlock.
  Fix: `STATE_PROBE` with `size==0` (coord) leaves admit running; only
  hash probe (`size!=0`) + chunk transfer stall. Guest retransmit replies
  without re-staging saves. MotK rebuild after sync.

- **2026-07-20 (netplay host-owned saves — hash probe + chunk transfer):**
  recomp-net: `RNET_STATE_MAX` → 8 MiB, `STATE_PROBE`/`PROBE_REPLY`, stall
  admit through probe + transfer; restored `rnet_session_wait_recv`.
  psx_netplay: guest sandbox `saves/netplay/`, host-only F-keys, match-start
  memcard probe, save = coord local write → hash-agree → transfer on miss +
  post-CRC verify; load same pattern + `hard_resync`. MotK `build-release`
  linked; verify Shift+F1 / F1 across LAN.

- **2026-07-20 (MotK title after FMV — leave-depth24 restage):**
  On exit from GP1 depth24, GL/VK `depth24_upload_policy` restaged full
  CPU VRAM as 1555 into the FBO. CPU still held packed RGB888 from MDEC →
  rainbow/static title background (text/overlays still drew as prims).
  V2: skip only framebuffer-sized depth24 transfers (keep texture A0s);
  on leave scissor-clear the skipped FB union (GL) — never blind-restage
  RGB888-as-1555. Char-select shrink-to-left-center still under probe
  (OFX=256 @ 512 CRTC looks correct; may be authored layout / separate).

- **2026-07-20 (MotK 2nd intro right-edge stretch):**
  `depth24_fix_trailing_margin` replicated the last good column when any
  chroma>40 pixel sat in the trailing 8 cols. On the starfield FMV that
  smeared stars into an 8-wide flickering strip. Now requires dense chroma
  (~12% of margin) and black-fills instead of column-replicate. Still no
  CRTC/content_w crop.

- **2026-07-20 (MotK netplay FMV — lockstep floor, not present path):**
  A/B: offline headless FMV ~59; two offline headless concurrent ~59; two
  netplay headless ~38–40. Not dual-CPU contention and not GL present.
  Lockstep (INPUT_CONFIRM frame barrier + same-tick input rendezvous)
  keeps both MDEC peaks aligned. Async confirm / peer drift made FMV
  *worse* (~22–28) via overlapped memory traffic. Barrier now UDP `poll()`
  (not `SDL_Delay(1)`); localhost peers pin to disjoint CPU halves (~45
  in A/B). Pipeline admit rewrite hung tick-0 — reverted.

- **2026-07-20 (MotK netplay FMV — restore pre-rematch vblank order):**
  User: same-machine netplay was 50–60 before rematch playback tweaks.
  Reverted `NetplayVblankGuard` present-before-admit and half-rate depth24
  present. Order is again finish→admit→pace→present. Kept: `s_present_w/h`
  clear (black rematch FMV), depth24 FBO upload skip, trailing-margin
  in-buffer fix, vsync-off while lockstep armed.

- **2026-07-20 (MotK netplay tick-0 hang — revert admit latency hacks):**
  After half-rate present, both peers armed lockstep then sat at frame 0
  until peer_disconnect. Cause: `SDL_Delay(0)` busy-spin starved peer UDP
  on dual localhost; same-call `try_admit` publish when CONFIRM pre-seen
  also unsafe. Reverted both.

- **2026-07-20 (MotK FMV netplay FPS — half-rate depth24 present):**
  Measured: headless dual-peer lockstep holds ~60 guest FPS through intro;
  windowed dual-peer ~30–40. Bottleneck is two GL CPU-presents serializing
  before the guest fiber resumes — not admit/guest. Fix: under netplay +
  depth24, present every other vblank (host-only; admit still every tick).

- **2026-07-20 (MotK FMV netplay FPS — skip depth24 FBO upload queue):**
  MDEC A0 was still queued as 1555 CPU→FBO uploads (`UP_RECTS_MAX`=16),
  force-flushing mid-movie. While `gpu_display_is_depth24()`, do not queue
  GL/VK uploads; on leave, drop queue (no full restage — see leave-depth24
  log above). Alone did not restore
  windowed netplay to offline rates (present cost remained).

- **2026-07-20 (netplay FMV host FPS — present/vsync ordering):**
  Offline MotK intro ~50+; netplay ~30–40 was host path, not guest
  divergence. Fixes (determinism unchanged): (1) force GL/VK swap
  interval 0 while lockstep is armed (restore on soft-exit) so driver
  vsync does not double-block after the wall pacer; (2) move
  `finish_frame`→present→`admit`+pacer so local Swap overlaps the peer's
  guest quantum. `turbo_loads` stays off in netplay.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK FMV right-edge — no present-width crop):**
  Upload-span + `content_w` left-aligned GL crop removed the chroma junk
  but replaced it with a flickering black pillar (span varied per frame,
  especially during lighting). Rework: keep full CRTC width always;
  `depth24_fix_trailing_margin` only replicates the last good column
  into the last 8 RGB cols when chroma junk is detected — in-buffer,
  no viewport shrink. Half-texel nearest UV clamp remains.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK FMV right-edge — trailing margin, not CRTC shrink):**
  Root cause: MotK depth24 crawl is 512×128 CRTC, but ~8 trailing RGB
  columns are stale/black in VRAM; GL edge sampling flickered that strip
  as garbage. Fix (no 2/3 width): track A0 upload span
  (`gpu_depth24_rgb_limit`); blank/crop last 8 cols on short depth24
  bands (`h<240`); `gl_renderer_present(..., content_w)` left-aligned
  UV crop + half-texel nearest clamp; screenshot skips `sync_cpu` on
  depth24 (was clobbering RGB888). MotK release+PGO rebuilt; user-verify
  2nd intro (Star Wars logo) edge + ~50 FPS.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK FMV right-edge / 2/3 revert):**
  Tried depth24 width=(CRTC*2)/3 (512→341) for right-edge junk; MotK
  intros rendered left-shifted with the right of the video clipped —
  confirms the Jul-18 finding (logo is centered in a 512 RGB line).
  Reverted 2/3. Kept: depth24→fmv_frame, short-band without force_4_3
  gate, nearest present on depth24. Right-edge junk needs a different
  fix (not shrinking CRTC width).

- **2026-07-19 (MotK FMV FPS after rematch patches):**
  Rematch video fixed; ~30–40 vs prior ~50+ was not a present-path
  regression. Prior ~50 med was MotK intro PGO (`PSX_PGO=use`); LTO-only
  baseline is ~39. Mistakenly cleared PGO — restored `PSX_PGO=use` with
  existing intro `.gcda`. `fmv_frame` restored (depth24 only forces
  `pin_43` short-band letterbox). Re-train via `scripts/pgo_motk_intro.sh`
  after large rematch edits if profiles go stale.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay rematch: black FMV = stale present tex size):**
  Root cause: `s_present_w/h` survived GL context destroy; rematch FMV same
  size as prior CPU present took `glTexSubImage2D` into a new unallocated
  `s_present_tex` → black. Cleared on shutdown + init_context. Also dropped
  per-frame `flush_cpu_uploads` on depth24 (was cutting intro ~50→~30 FPS);
  depth24 CPU scanout needs neither FBO sync nor upload flush.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay rematch: black FMV, audio OK):**
  Rematch linked and played, but MotK intros had XA audio with black video
  (FPS still dipped ~30–40 → MDEC ran). Earlier mis-attribution to sync_cpu;
  also reset present/FPS/MDEC/iso session statics; `iso_close` before reopen;
  depth24 forces 4:3 pin for short-band letterbox.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay rematch: sticky I_STAT/I_MASK):**
  After cycle-reset fix, rematch still starved: dump meta showed
  `psx_cycle_count=4` with leftover `i_stat=VBlank` + game `i_mask`.
  `interrupts_init` / `memory_init` now clear I_STAT/I_MASK (+ mem_ctrl);
  `starvation_ring_reset` on `session_reboot` so dumps are rematch-clean.

- **2026-07-19 (stick→D-Pad axial deadzone again):**
  Radial+sign for digital stick→D-Pad made left/right fire Up/Down from tiny
  Y drift (jump/crouch). Stick→button sources use per-axis `controller_deadzone`
  again; analog `axes_to_pad_pair` / hybrid stick-detect stay radial.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay rematch: stuck `psx_in_device_service`):**
  Rematch still froze after `lockstep armed`: soft-exit longjmps out of the
  vblank callback while inside `psx_devices_service_to_now`, leaving
  `psx_in_device_service=1`. Every later `psx_advance_cycles` then skips
  device service → no vblanks → hang after tick-0. Fix: clear the guard on
  every scheduler longjmp escape; `psx_cycles_reset_for_boot()` zeros the
  guest clock + deadline bookkeeping at `session_reboot`.

- **2026-07-19 (Digital stick→D-Pad radial deadzone):**
  Stick-as-D-Pad used a per-axis square threshold so centre drift twitched
  movement even with a large launcher deadzone. Stick axis→button sources now
  require radial magnitude past `controller_deadzone` (same idea as
  `axes_to_pad_pair`); triggers stay per-axis. Hybrid stick-detect matches.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay rematch HLE shell-skip latch):**
  After soft-return rematch both peers linked (`lockstep armed`) then froze:
  `s_shell_skipped` stayed set from the first match so HLE boot-skip never
  re-fired and both ran the interactive BIOS shell under netplay.
  `psx_bios_hle_configure` now clears the latch; `cdrom_init` resets boot
  disc speed to 1x; lobby launch uses `input_player=-1` (auto) again.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay rematch session_id + endpoint guard):**
  Rematch HELLO hang: server now allocates a fresh `session_id` on every
  `start`/`launch` (stale BYE/HELLO from the prior UDP session no longer match)
  and refuses start when host/guest endpoints are empty. Client refuses
  `fill_netplay_launch` / `launch_pending` when `peer_hostport` is missing.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay return-to-lobby rematch):**
  Lobby WS stays up across Launch. Window-close / Escape / peer BYE soft-exits
  via `PSX_RUN_RETURN_TO_LOBBY` (scheduler longjmp or pre-entry flag) instead of
  `exit(0)` when the match started from a lobby room. Teardown keeps the WS;
  launcher resumes on `netplay_room` with ready cleared; rematch Launch
  re-enters `session_reboot` (re-init guest + netplay). Server clears ready on
  `start` so both peers must Ready again.

- **2026-07-19 (lobby server → closed-source Rust):**
  Proprietary `recomp-net-server` (Rust) owns WS lobby + privacy/docs;
  removed C `servers/lobby` from open `recomp-net`. Client WS helpers
  vendored at `runtime/src/lobby_ws/`. Default
  `ws://netplay.retcomm.net:8765`.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay lobby server + launcher menus):**
  Lobby WS+JSON owned by proprietary `recomp-net-server` (was C
  `servers/lobby/` under open recomp-net);
  `psx_lobby_client` + shared launcher home → Offline / Netplay → lobbies table
  (host/join/password). Launch hands `PsxNetplayConfig` to
  `psx_netplay_start` (LAN endpoints from lobby). ICE relay stubbed.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay peer disconnect QoL):**
  Barrier `SDL_PollEvent` on `SDL_QUIT`/Escape → `shutdown_runtime`+exit.
  recomp-net `BYE` (pkt 7) + `rnet_session_peer_disconnected(~1.5s)`;
  `psx_netplay_shutdown` sends BYE. Surviving peer prints and exits instead
  of spinning in admit.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay latch + INPUT_CONFIRM + exclusive capture):**
  Host stages one pad per sim tick (`latched_for_tick`); barrier only
  re-samples via `needs_local_sample`, stalls on `input_desync`
  (INPUT_CONFIRM hash mismatch). Netplay capture is exclusive to the
  assigned PlayerInput (no keyboard-all / all-controllers merge) so peer
  hashes agree. Cleared on `finish_frame` advance. recomp-net: preserve
  early peer INPUT_CONFIRM when activating (wipe raced slower peer into
  permanent stall). Smoke: two headless MotK peers both `lockstep armed`,
  frames advance, no INPUT desync.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay lockstep stall + per-peer input device):**
  True delay-sync gate: pre-scheduler + each vblank `finish_frame` then
  blocking `poll_admit` (guest fiber parks; no free-run on admit fail /
  linking). Auto/`--net-input-player`: host samples P1 device, guest samples
  P2 when assigned (same-PC C40+keyboard); pad blob deadzone normalize.

- **2026-07-19 (netplay pad ownership — session slots always plugged):**
  Host local device → net-slot 0 (sim P1); guest local → net-slot 1 (sim P2).
  While active, SIO is network-only (no local/`override` writes). Both session
  ports stay connected from `psx_netplay_start` through linking so in-game
  2P/VS detect works; `refresh_player_devices` no longer clears them.

- **2026-07-19 (delay-sync netplay bring-up — recomp-net LAN):**
  Wired `recomp-net` into the runtime as CLI/env LAN delay-sync (not GGPO).
  `psx_netplay.{c,h}` + CMake auto-discover `../recomp-net`; vblank owns
  `pump`/`try_admit`/`publish`/`advance`; local pads stage only — publish is
  sole SIO writer while active. Turbo + low-latency re-sample gated off.
  Lobby UI / ICE server deferred. Smoke: two procs with `--netplay --net-slot`.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK title/char-select — savestate PC + flat GEO batch):**
  User still saw ~10 FPS after draw-area reject. Real char-select profile:
  ~30k/s on-screen GP0(68h) starfield dots, `gpu_share`~0.8 (not empty clip).
  Also: `boot_state_load` forced `pc=entry_pc`, so F1 loads desynced (display
  off; false ~60 FPS). Restored saved PC; batched flat GEO tris in
  `gpu_gl_renderer.c`. Char-select Shift+F1: **~60 FPS locked**, gpu_share~0.06.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK title/char-select — GPU draw-area reject re-applied):**
  Shift+F1 title + Arcade char select were &lt;10 FPS: same OT drain as the
  inter-movie cliff — GP0(E3/E4)=(0,0)-(0,0) + thousands of clipped `0x68`
  dots / quads; GL built 2 tris/prim. Re-applied inclusive draw-area reject
  in `gpu.c` (prior revert blamed a “gap race”; crawl wrap was the separate
  24bpp present-width bug). Alone insufficient for live starfield menus.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK intro — native/hot/inline + multi-run PGO):**
  Shipped `-march=native`, `[recompiler] hot_funcs` for VLC
  `0x8006A9F8`/`0x8006CBE4`, Release-inline `debug_server_log_call_entry`
  (cpu_state.h), HIT-inline `psx_icache_fetch` (psx_icache.h), multi-run
  PGO train (`PGO_TRAIN_RUNS`/`PGO_TRAIN_SECS`). Remeasure clean logo still
  **~51 med** (more mid/high-50 samples; not locked 60). Load-delay cycle
  volume remains the ceiling. Inter-movie cliff open. No MotK VSync HLE.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK intro — PGO + advance_cycles host cost):**
  (1) `psx_advance_cycles`: drop per-charge watchdog/PC-sample (moved into
  `service_to_now`, HARD_CAP cadence); (2) `psx_devices_mmio_sync` recomputes
  deadline in-place instead of dirtying `next_service=0` (was forcing service
  on the next insn after every GPU/CD/MDEC MMIO); (3) MotK intro PGO via
  `scripts/pgo_motk_intro.sh` (`-DPSX_PGO=generate|use`, 311 .gcda). Clean
  logo (until inter-movie cliff): **~49–51 med** (was ~39 LTO-only). Crawl
  after gap recovers ~47–50. Inter-movie ~7 FPS GPU cliff still open. No
  MotK VSync HLE.

- **2026-07-19 (MotK intro — VLC host opts + Release LTO):**
  Host-side work on MotK VLC (`0x8006A9F8`/`0x8006CBE4`), not disc cache:
  (1) idle_skip no longer defeats IRQ fast-path; deferred idle GPR snap;
  (2) IRQ mid-path when bits already pending; (3) `psx_slice_block` header
  inline when parked; (4) main-RAM `psx_cyc_load_word`/`half` inlined;
  (5) MotK Release `CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_RELEASE` (-flto).
  Logo window: ~34 med → ~39 med (samples mostly 38–40). Still short of 50;
  load-delay cycle volume remains the ceiling (PSX_LOAD_DELAY=0 → hundreds
  FPS). Inter-movie ~5–7 FPS GPU cliff open. No MotK VSync HLE.

- **2026-07-18 (MotK intro — FMV pace: inline cycle advance):**
  Host FPS still short of 50 with real MDEC/XA. Inlined `psx_advance_cycles`
  (deadline fast path) + merged load fudge/cost into one charge; bit-exact
  DC-only MDEC IDCT. Release FMV ~33 med / ~39 avg (steadier; was dipping to
  teens). Gap ~7. Remaining: static VLC `0x8006A9F8`/`0x8006CBE4` + load-delay
  host cost. Do not revive MotK VSync HLE / HARD_CAP without mdec rising.

- **2026-07-18 (MotK intro — 24bpp CRTC width + short-band present):**
  MotK FMV CRTC is 512 (X1/X2÷5); logo centered in 512 RGB (~86..431).
  Reverted blanket 24-bit mode×2/3 (341 cropped the right). Width = GP1(06h)÷
  dot-clock for 15/24-bit. Short GP1(07h)=128 no longer fills 4:3 — present
  letterboxes src_h/240 (GL/SDL/VK). Inter-movie GPU cliff still open.
  CD-only `spu_render` kept.

- **2026-07-18 (MotK intro FMV — false 60 FPS / no video; rollback):**
  MotK `load_accel.vsync_query` + event-horizon_any / HARD_CAP→564480 /
  in-exception VBlank chunking produced host FPS ~60 with **no MDEC**
  (`mdec_decode_count` stayed 0, display disabled) — guest time raced past the
  STR. A/B: VSync(-1) HLE alone is enough to keep MotK MDEC at 0; disabling
  it restores decode/XA. Reverted those accelerations for MotK; kept sticky
  CD IRQ deadline, load-delay coalesce, MDEC DMA bulk/IDCT skips. Real intro
  with video is again ~30–40 FPS host-bound under load-delay. Do not claim
  MotK FMV pace wins without `fmv_state.mdec_decode_count` rising.

- **2026-07-18 (earlier same day — sticky CD deadline + load-path host cost):**
  `cdrom_cycles_to_irq` sticky presented IRQ → 1-cycle deadline after sync;
  fixed. Load-delay coalesce + inline `psx_advance_cycles`. Necessary but not
  sufficient for MotK FMV ≥50 with video.

- **2026-07-11 (Tomba 2 OpenGL full-attract performance + audio acceptance):**
  Resolved the shared renderer/overlay/capture cascade that made Beach, Whoopee
  FMVs, Mines, and Mine Cart slow. OpenGL now avoids mandatory present readback,
  batches Tomba's painter-ordered blend stream, and suppresses unchanged 30 Hz
  source presents. Overlay dispatch now distinguishes exact lazy entries from
  CPS interior continuations: continuations use the loaded range owner first,
  while exact entries reached inside local dirty flow can publish their cached
  native DLL. The hot `0x80106424`/`0x80106688` FMV helpers consequently dropped
  from ~60 interpreted entries/frame to zero. Small dynamic-text DLL images are
  mapped on a bounded worker (141 Tomba variants, not the 712-DLL vault), and
  auto-capture base64/file I/O now runs from a coherent RAM/seed snapshot on a
  low-priority worker. The audio bridge uses real callback duration, bounded
  P-only correction, and a measured 160 ms reserve inside its existing 250 ms
  ring. Release acceptance: 540 s / 107 five-second records, Beach -> Whoopee ->
  Mines -> Mine Cart -> repeat, guest min 59.76 Hz / median 59.94 Hz, **zero
  output underruns**, zero post-start overflows, and no cache growth (849 DLLs).
  Current-code screenshots visually confirmed Beach, FMV, Mines, and Mine Cart.

- **2026-07-10 (Tomba 2 Whoopee auto-skip dwell + native-wide Beach backdrop):**
  Added an opt-in silent-MDEC post-decode hold so presentation-side FMV
  auto-skip remains unpaced through a preloaded logo's authored release wait;
  the faithful guest timeline is unchanged and the default remains four
  vblanks. Added title-opted native-wide mirror gates for flat primitives and
  the textured pre-shaded backdrop phase. This keeps the canonical 4:3 buffer
  untouched while filling Tomba 2 Beach Town at 16:9 and 21:9 without stretching
  the later 3D foreground. Also fixed JSON escaping in the `fmv_state` path and
  extended its resolved-config reporting. Validated Release build, unattended
  first-attract captures at 4:3/16:9/21:9, and zero unknown dispatches.

- **2026-07-02 (HLE PIVOT implemented — HLE as a first-class swappable tier, gbarecomp model):**
  USER-DIRECTED pivot (supersedes "no HLE" §0; CLAUDE.md amended 2026-07-02, memory
  hle_tier_architecture.md). Built the full stack this session: (1) EMITTER —
  full_function_emitter.cpp now emits a null-by-default `g_psx_bios_hle_hook` consult at
  the top of every psx_dispatch_impl iteration (pre-normalize phys, BEFORE the game/
  dirty-RAM/static backends; handled ⇒ resume at $ra; NULL default = pure LLE,
  dispatch-identical). (2) RUNTIME TIER — runtime/src/bios_hle.c(+.h): v1 call-HLE =
  the B0 event family (DeliverEvent/OpenEvent/CloseEvent/TestEvent/EnableEvent/
  DisableEvent) ground-truthed against the SCPH1001 kernel disassembly (Ghidra,
  0xBFC11644..0xBFC11A84; EvCB [0x120]/[0x124], stride 0x1C), operating on the real
  guest EvCBs, callback delivery via psx_dispatch_call with the kernel-true $ra
  0x1720; everything else (WaitEvent/threads/pads/card/A0/C0) falls through to LLE.
  (3) BOOT HLE — one-shot shell-entry intercept (RAM 0x30000; LoadRunShell's indirect
  call always dispatches): real recompiled kernel init + SYSTEM.CNF + EXE load run
  authentically under boot-turbo; only the shell (boot animation) is skipped. The old
  fast_boot snapshot restore is REMOVED (fast_boot=true now aliases boot-skip only).
  (4) SELECTION — [runtime] bios_hle / bios_hle_keep_intro / hle_scheduler in
  config_loader (+ settings.toml bios_hle mirror), PSX_BIOS_HLE / PSX_BIOS_HLE_KEEP_INTRO
  env, startup banner bios_backend=/bios_boot=. PSX_HLE_SCHEDULER spike folded in
  (default via psx_hle_scheduler_set_default, env wins). (5) OBSERVABILITY — always-on
  16K HLE ring (route LLE/HLE/boot-skip) + hle_dump TCP command (../TCP_COMMANDS.md).
  Regen era-consistent: BIOS + Tomba + MMX6 images (emitter changed). NEXT: Tomba
  save+load validation under BOTH backends (user drives); overlay-shard cg-tag refresh
  per title; grow the handler set (UnDeliverEvent, RCnt, A0 libc) with kernel-decompile
  + Beetle checks per handler.
- **2026-07-01 (Tomba pause-menu wedge RESOLVED — stale-recompiler shards, guard shipped):**
  The post-merge Tomba menu wedge (loaded saves only) was NOT the IRQ-resume class the
  prior handoff claimed. Added an always-on exception-EXIT half to irqctx_ring
  (interrupts.c: take_pc/real_epc/exit_pc/exit_reason/same_thread/restored/v1/ra/redirects)
  — it proved every VBLANK resume restores the interrupted GPRs correctly, and the
  0x80016588 "spin" is the normal per-frame vsync wait. Real root cause: autocompiled
  overlay shards were emitted by a recompiler binary (build-t2, 07:39) OLDER than the
  09:28 emitter changes (553d993), yet stamped with the CURRENT cg tag (compile_overlays
  derives the tag from --runtime-include, nothing verified the emitting binary). The
  stale-emitter shards corrupted the display-list task queue (0x801FD800 slots) during
  load-game at Stormy Mountain → menu drew nothing. Repro matrix (compiled/interp ×
  newgame/load), cache-absent A/B, and RAM diff (empty OT 0x8009CA10 vs linked prims
  @0x800Bxxxx) pinned it; recompiler mtime vs emitter commit time was the smoking gun.
  FIXED: rebuilt recompiler, purged + regenerated build-cosim AND build-prod caches —
  menu opens with cache fully enabled. GUARD (class-closing, general): psxrecomp-game
  now bakes the emitter-source hash (shared canonical list
  runtime/codegen_hash_sources.cmake + hash_codegen.cmake) and prints it via
  `--codegen-hash`; compile_overlays.py HARD-FAILS when the binary hash ≠ the tag hash
  (verified positive + negative, both cache and --static modes). Kept the
  same_thread_resume GPR-restore refinement in interrupts.c (ring-verified equal-value
  no-op in practice; faithful). Tooling gaps logged in memory
  (divergence_tooling_gaps_2026_07_01). PENDING: MMX6 cutscene→gameplay gate
  (interrupts.c changed), user validation of prod build (menu + title/save-menu lag —
  lag likely the same stale-shard all-interp fallback + rehash churn).

- **2026-06-27 (device-region MMIO read waits — DONE, branch wt/tomba2-mmio-waits off the
  I-cache tip):** Replaced the placeholder `region = (phys<RAM_SIZE)?3:0` in psx_cyc_readmem
  (memory.c) with the full Beetle MemRW device-region read-wait table (libretro.cpp:859-1131),
  size-aware: main RAM (phys<0x800000) +3; SPU 0x1F801C00-1FFF +36 (32-bit) / +16 (8/16-bit);
  CDC 0x1F801800-180F +6×size; GPU/MDEC/SysControl/FrontIO/SIO/IRQ/DMA/Timers (within
  0x1F801000-113F) +1; BIOS ROM / Expansion-PIO / unmatched +0; scratchpad +0 (early-out).
  Threaded the access size (1/2/4) from psx_cyc_load_word/half/byte + psx_cyc_lwc2_read into
  psx_cyc_readmem (the SPU/CDC waits are width-dependent). The device wait combines with the
  existing +2 completion (+1 LWC2) and fudge exactly as Beetle ReadMemory (LDAbsorb = region +
  completion). RUNTIME-ONLY — psx_cyc_load_* signatures unchanged, so NO emitter regen; just
  rebuild runtime/cyctest. New ruler #2 loops `mmio_timer` (Timer0 read → +3 = 1 dev + 2 compl)
  and `mmio_spu` (32-bit SPU read → +38 = 36 + 2). VALIDATED: cyctest COMPILED (4600) == Beetle
  (4382) EXACT on ALL 15 loops incl. mmio_timer +3 / mmio_spu +38; the 13 prior loops unchanged.
  Tomba 2 boots past the BIOS to its "SCEA Presents" intro splash, total_checks advancing, no
  freeze (the faster-MMIO change did not trigger a device-timing cascade like load=4 did).
  RESIDUAL (documented, unmodeled dynamic axis): DMACycleSteal — Beetle adds the live DMA
  bus-steal count to EVERY read (libretro.cpp:868); non-zero only during active DMA, needs the
  steal count threaded out of the DMA controller, can't be isolated by a static ruler.
  memory.c + gen_testrom.py.

- **2026-06-27 (I-cache fetch — Stage 2 DONE: compiled-path emit + production default-on):**
  Both static emitters now charge the I-cache fetch cost at each cache-line LEADER, BEFORE
  the per-instruction interlock/load (Beetle ReadInstruction order, so a fetch miss clears
  the pending load give-back first). Leader = a block leader / mid-block jump-table target
  (any non-fall-through entry → possibly-cold line) OR a 16-byte-line start (addr&0xC==0);
  intra-line fall-through followers are provably hits (the leader refilled the line to its
  end) so they emit nothing (+0). code_generator (game): `addr` is already the KSEG0 runtime
  PC. full_function_emitter (BIOS): the loop addr is the ROM/compile addr, mapped to the
  RUNTIME guest PC via the existing `relocate_ra` (BIOS main stays in-place KSEG1 0xBFC..
  uncached; kernel Part 2 → 0x500+, shell → 0x80030000+) so the shared TV array evolves
  identically to the interp's cpu->pc and the KSEG1 (>=0xA0000000) uncached test sees the
  true virtual address. The compiled path emits at the SAME address value the interp would
  for the same instruction (they share s_icache_tv), so mixed compiled/interp stays
  consistent. VALIDATED: ruler #2 COMPILED (port 4600, PSX_ICACHE=1) == Beetle (4382) EXACT
  on all 13 loops incl. `icache_miss +14` (was +0 pre-Stage-2); ruler #1 [0x1C5C→0x1CA4]
  steady delta 0 (56==56) AND native now produces the I-cache cold-refill spikes (77/84,
  Beetle's range) that were absent before — exact per-hit magnitude varies run-to-run
  because the two processes free-run (Rule 16), not a bug. Tomba 2 boots past the load wedge
  → intro FMV (jungle) + crisp PS BIOS logo, total_checks advancing, no freeze. Then flipped
  `psx_icache_enabled()` DEFAULT ON (PSX_ICACHE=0 still disables for A/B) — re-validated the
  default-on path (cyctest no-env == +14; Tomba 2 boots clean). psx_icache.c + both emitters.
  NEXT axis: DMA cycle-steal / device-region MMIO load waits (SPU +36 etc.), currently
  unmodeled. Eventually merge wt/tomba2-load-accuracy to master after cross-title regen+smoke.

- **2026-06-27 (I-cache fetch — MODEL built + interp-validated EXACT; Stage 1 of 2):**
  New runtime/src/psx_icache.c: faithful direct-mapped (4 KB / 256-line) instruction-cache
  fetch cost, transcribed from Beetle PS_CPU::ReadInstruction — HIT +0 (no give-back clear),
  KSEG1/uncached +4, cached miss +3 + refill from the missing word to the line end (earlier
  words stay invalid), miss clears the load give-back. Mirrors only the per-word TV tag array.
  Wired into the dirty-RAM interp (exec_one) per instruction, charged BEFORE §1 (Beetle order).
  New ruler #2 loop `icache_miss` (loop top + victim 0x1000 apart alias the same line → refill
  miss every iteration). VALIDATED interp vs Beetle (PSX_FORCE_INTERP=1 PSX_ICACHE=1):
  icache_miss native +14 == Beetle +14; the other 12 loops unchanged at +0 fetch. So the
  hit AND refill-miss costs are MEASURED equal to the oracle on the interp path. Opt-in via
  PSX_ICACHE=1 (default OFF) — charging fetch in only one backend would fork mixed
  compiled/interp timing. Default-off → no production change (Tomba 2 FMV/logo verified
  byte-identical). Commit 958a928.
  STAGE 2 (pending): emit psx_icache_fetch at each cache-line leader in BOTH static emitters
  (code_generator + full_function_emitter), using the RUNTIME address (handle ROM->RAM
  relocated shell code); flip PSX_ICACHE default on so both backends charge it; validate
  ruler #1's cold first-hit spike (Beetle 84/77 vs steady 56) reproduces on the compiled
  path. RISK: the compiled cache state must match Beetle cycle-for-cycle across the whole
  boot to reproduce the cold spike — a careful cache-state-fidelity validation.

- **2026-06-27 (interp-path Δ-ruler — INTERP == Beetle EXACT on all 12 components):**
  Closed the last validation gap: the dirty-RAM INTERPRETER is now MEASURED equal to the
  oracle, not just shared-by-construction. New tooling: `PSX_FORCE_INTERP=1` makes
  `dirty_ram_is_dirty` (memory.c) report all RAM above the kernel window dirty, so the
  dispatcher routes clean compiled game text through the dirty-RAM interpreter (the same path
  overlays take) — no emitter/dispatch change. Launch psx-cyctest with the env set; the test
  ROM runs interpreted (dirty_ram_insns → hundreds of millions). measure.py --port 4600
  (interp) vs 4382 (Beetle): ALL 12 loops match EXACTLY (baseline/alu/load/load2/load_use/
  div/div_spaced/mult/gte_rtps/gte_nclip/gte_read_use/ld_div). Commit b0391bc.
  TWO PROCESS LESSONS (cost real time — now in cyctest README): (1) launch psx-cyctest via
  PowerShell Start-Process — a bash '&' launch fails to boot (pc=0); (2) sample cyc_watch /
  freeze_check AT STEADY STATE — an early query (before the BIOS boots to the EXE entry)
  reports dirty_ram_insns=0 / warm-up values. That premature-sampling artifact was the entire
  "dispatch paradox" I chased (the interp engages only after the EXE entry is reached).
  NEXT axis: I-cache fetch (ruler #1 84/77 cold-refill spikes).

- **2026-06-27 (GTE-read + MFC0 + muldiv give-back — IMPLEMENTED + VALIDATED, ruler #2 100%):**
  Closed the last steady-state divergences. KEY METHODOLOGY FINDING (Rule 15): Beetle's
  cyc_watch must be sampled at STEADY STATE — its boot/warm-up window reports the
  no-give-back value, which is why earlier sessions mis-recorded gte_rtps as "+15 EXACT"
  (true steady = +11). Added ruler #2 probes (load_use, gte_read_use, ld_div) to Δ-gate it.
  Shipped: `psx_gte_read` (MFC2/CFC2: stall to gte_ts_done AND arm ld_absorb=stall/
  ld_which_t=rt give-back; MTC2/CTC2 keep stall-only `psx_gte_stall`); MFC0 arms
  ld_absorb=0/ld_which_t=rt (suppresses a following load's fudge); `psx_muldiv_stall` now
  CONSUMES read_absorb during the MFLO/MFHI stall + the muldiv_ts_done-1 off-by-one — all
  transcribed from Beetle cpu.cpp:1332-1341/1723-1736, in both emitters + the interp.
  **All 12 ruler #2 loops == Beetle at steady state** (gte_rtps 18→14, gte_nclip 11→7,
  gte_read_use 19→14, ld_div 45→49 fixed; the 8 CPU-load/alu/div/mult loops held); ruler #1
  delta 0; Tomba 2 FMV plays (no regression). The R3000A load-delay + GTE/muldiv interlock
  is now hardware-faithful across every micro-benchmark. NEXT axis: I-cache fetch (ruler #1
  84/77 cold-refill spikes). Commits on wt/tomba2-load-accuracy (unpushed).

- **2026-06-27 (load ReadFudge/LDAbsorb — IMPLEMENTED + VALIDATED, both rulers exact):**
  Shipped the shared per-instruction R3000A load-delay interlock. New `runtime/include/
  psx_cyc.h`: §1 base + GPR_DEPRES + DO_LDS (`psx_cyc_step`) as static-inline helpers over
  new CPUState fields `read_absorb[33]/read_absorb_which/read_fudge/ld_which_t/ld_absorb`;
  `psx_cyc_load_word/half/byte` + `psx_cyc_lwc2_read` in memory.c do the Beetle ReadMemory
  timing (clear give-back, +2 fudge iff predecessor committed no load, region RAM +3 +
  completion +2/+1 as the LDAbsorb give-back, scratchpad +0). The pure dep/res classifier
  `psx_cyc_dep_res_mask` (transcribed from Beetle per-opcode GPR_DEP/RES) lives in
  psx_instr_cost.h. Wired into the dirty interp + BOTH static emitters (code_generator game,
  full_function_emitter+strict_translator BIOS); loads now route value reads through the
  UNCHARGED psx_read_* (cpu->read_* rewired in main.cpp; the flat +4 charge_main_ram_read is
  gone). **Δ-validated against Beetle:** ruler #2 `load2` +10 → **+11** == Beetle, every other
  component still exact (alu+1/load+5/div+38/mult+15/gte_rtps+15/gte_nclip+8); ruler #1
  [c5c→ca4] 54 → **56** == Beetle steady-state (84/77 spikes = I-cache cold refill, P2). Tomba2
  boots to the intro FMV (screenshot pixels, no regression). Builds clean (tools/BIOS/game/
  runtime/cyctest). FOLLOW-UP (separate commit): GTE-read/MFC0 give-back + muldiv-stall
  give-back consumption (don't affect rulers; needed for mixed-code faithfulness). Supersedes
  the "MODEL NAILED, impl pending" entry below.

- **2026-06-27 (load ReadFudge/LDAbsorb — MODEL NAILED empirically, impl pending):**
  Derived the last load-path component (the residual on both rulers) by measuring
  Beetle's PER-INSTRUCTION cost via adjacent-PC region cyc_watch. Confirmed:
  fudge = +2 iff the previous instruction committed no pending load (ReadFudge=0x20;
  `(reg>>4)&2` is 0 for all real regs), else 0; region+completion=5 (LDAbsorb excludes
  fudge); the load-delay-slot instruction does NOT absorb (its §1 precedes its DO_LDS),
  the instructions after it do. Per-instruction Beetle data: load = lw7/addiu1/bne0/nop0;
  load2 = lw7/lw6/addiu1/bne0/nop0. Full model + implementation spec in
  `accuracy/load_readfudge_ldabsorb.md`. Implementation is pervasive (per-instruction
  ReadAbsorb + GPR_DEP/RES in both emitters + interp) → a focused next task on a clean
  tree; validate via the ruler-loop anchors (baseline 3 / load 8 / load2 14). No code
  changed this step (read-only empirical derivation).

- **2026-06-27 (interp-path cycle ruler — enabler DONE + validated):** The dirty
  interp now emits `debug_server_cyc_observe(pc)` per instruction (gated), so
  interp-executed PCs are cyc_watch-anchorable (were not). Validated: a live
  Tomba2 overlay interp loop (0x8010724C) records stable cyc_watch hits at 38
  cyc/iter, parity with compiled-PC anchoring; FMV no-regression over 150M+
  interp insns. Commit fc85d8b. This lets interp-side cycle work (the muldiv +
  GTE stalls) be MEASURED, not just by-construction. REMAINING for a fully
  isolated single-component interp ruler: the cyctest harness does not route
  indirect jumps to the dirty interp (a jalr to a scratch dirty address left
  dirty_ram_insns=0 there), so a clean dirty-RAM component loop needs cyctest
  interp-dispatch wiring (or an overlay_cache=off Tomba2 component anchor).

- **2026-06-27 (GTE per-command completion-stall — VALIDATED EXACT):** Modeled
  GTE (COP2) command latency + stall-on-COP2-access. New CPUState.gte_ts_done;
  a GTE command arms it (now + cost-1, serializing back-to-back ops); any COP2
  reg access (MFC2/CFC2/MTC2/CTC2/LWC2/SWC2) stalls to it. Cost table
  (psx_cycles.c) transcribed+verified from beetle gte.cpp op returns (note
  AVSZ4=5 not the psx-spx-doc's 6). Set armed in the shared gte_execute (both
  backends); stall emitted at every COP2 reg-access site in both emitters + the
  interp (offset cancels like muldiv). Added gte_rtps/gte_nclip loops to ruler
  #2: native +15/+8 == Beetle +15/+8 EXACT; all other components unchanged;
  Tomba2 boots to FMV no-regression. Commit ec1fd76. Required regen. UNPUSHED.

- **2026-06-27 (dirty-interp mult/div completion-stall — backend parity):**
  Completed the mult/div stall to the SECOND backend. The dirty-RAM interpreter
  (Tomba2 overlays) charged 0 for mult/div while the compiled emitters already
  set `muldiv_ts_done` + stall MFHI/MFLO — an inter-backend cost inconsistency
  that drifts the shared guest-cycle timeline. `dirty_ram_interp.c` now mirrors
  the compiled emitter exactly via the shared helpers (MULT→`psx_mult_latency_s`,
  MULTU→`_u`, DIV/DIVU→37, MFHI/MFLO→`psx_muldiv_stall`), under
  `PSX_ENABLE_BLOCK_CYCLES`. The interp charges base after exec_one (vs compiled
  "+1 at top") but the set/stall offset cancels (verified algebraically). The
  latency VALUES are already oracle-EXACT on rulers #1/#2 (compiled path); this
  makes the interp apply the identical model. Validated: Tomba2 boots to FMV,
  no regression. Caveat: validation is by-construction + no-regression, NOT a
  direct interp Δ — interp emits no cyc_observe and the testrom isn't an overlay,
  so a true interp-path ruler (interp cyc_observe + force-interp routing) is
  future tooling. Commit 75d5d1a, runtime-only, no regen, UNPUSHED.

- **2026-06-27 (load=4 boot wedge RESOLVED — faithful guest-cycle pad ACK):**
  The oracle-accurate load wait-state (=4) had deterministically wedged Tomba 2
  boot in the BIOS shell (handle s1=104 → 1672-stride table index → wild ptr
  0x8013B608 → RAM corruption → pc=0). Step A (confirm, not hypothesise): the
  proximate runaway was **100% controller (pad) polling** — `sio_irq_dump` showed
  the last 150+ SIO IRQs all `source=pad, delay=4, active_device=PAD, mc_state=0`
  (card idle), NOT the memcard enumeration the handoff guessed. Source-confirmed
  unfaithfulness: the pad fast-path (`sio.c:1386`) armed the access-paced
  `sio_irq_countdown=SIO_IRQ_DELAY_PAD(4)`, decremented once **per SIO register
  access** (sio_tick is only ever called cycles=0), so pad ACK→IRQ7 was
  access-count-paced, not guest-cycle-paced; the faster (accurate) CPU fired it at
  the wrong guest-cycle phase vs the cycle-paced timers/VBLANK → BIOS pad-detect
  state machine diverged. Step B (faithful fix): the pad fast-path now arms the
  **guest-cycle-paced ack scheduler** (`sio_pending_ack`/`sio_ack_remaining =
  BAUD+ACK = 1258 cyc`, driven by `sio_advance`←`psx_advance_cycles`), identical
  to the already-faithful card path. RESULT: load=4 boots **past the wedge to the
  intro FMV** (screenshot-verified, frame 11k+ stable). Ruler #1 native 54 vs
  Beetle 56 = the known load-ReadFudge gap on the load=4 branch, NOT a regression
  (SIO timing can't change CPU instruction cost). Runtime-only (`runtime/src/sio.c`),
  no regen, UNCOMMITTED. Write-up: WEDGE_load4_shell_rootcause.md. Follow-up
  (completeness, non-blocking): axis5 Fix-6 / "1.0e-e2" fully removes the pad
  fast-path so pad+card share one shifter path — needs menu input validation.

- **2026-06-27 (BIOS emitter muldiv stall — ruler #1 now EXACT):** Applied
  per-instruction cycle charging + the mult/div completion-stall to the BIOS
  emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp: +1 at the top of every in-function
  instruction + the 4 inlined orphaned-delay-slot sites; block-up-front charge
  off in per-insn mode) and StrictTranslator (MULTU/DIV/DIVU → psx_muldiv_set,
  MFHI/MFLO → psx_muldiv_stall). RESULT: ruler #1 [0x80001C5C→0x80001CA4] native
  30→56 == Beetle 56, STEADY DELTA 0 — EXACT. Both rulers now match the oracle for
  mult/div (ruler #2 game-side already exact). FMV no regression (i_stat 0x8D,
  full frame). Commit 180b821. The +1-at-top convention cancels the divu-set /
  mflo-stall offset identically to the game emitter (both exact). NEXT: I-cache
  fetch (ruler #1 residual = Beetle's 84-on-cold-hit refill spikes vs native flat
  56); then load wait-state calibration (memory.c +6 → ReadFudge model); then GTE.

- **2026-06-27 (RULER #2 closed + mult/div completion-stall VALIDATED EXACT):**
  Built the full cycle micro-benchmark harness (ruler #2) and used it to land the
  biggest Stage-2 component.
  - **ruler #2 = `tools/cycle_testrom/`**: hand-encoded PS-X EXE of single-component
    isolation loops (baseline/alu/load/load2/div/div_spaced/mult), each measured by
    consecutive-anchor Δ = one iteration; baseline subtraction isolates the cost.
    Both backends boot the SAME synthetic disc (mkpsxiso; license region extracted
    from an OWNED disc via dumpsxiso — LOCAL ONLY, gitignored). Beetle loads it via
    --disc; native via a dedicated psx-cyctest runtime target (boots disc, serial
    CYCT-00101 so disc-identity matches). measure.py compares per-component costs.
  - **Beetle ORACLE costs** (the HW targets): baseline 3, alu +1, load +5, load2
    +11 (2nd load +1 = ReadFudge), div +38 (~36 stall), div_spaced +38 (fillers
    ABSORBED), mult +15 (~13 stall).
  - **MULT/DIV completion-stall IMPLEMENTED + VALIDATED EXACT.** MULT/MULTU/DIV/DIVU
    set CPUState.muldiv_ts_done = now+latency (DIV=37; MULT via MULT_Tab24 14/10/7
    on operand magnitude); MFLO/MFHI stall guest cycles to the deadline
    (psx_muldiv_set/stall in psx_cycles.c). Native previously charged ZERO. Required
    PER-INSTRUCTION cycle charging (PSX_CODEGEN_CYCLE_PER_INSN) — now the DEFAULT on
    this audit branch — so the stall absorbs (the running cycle count must be
    accurate mid-block; block-up-front can't). Game emitter emits set/stall at the
    op sites. RESULT vs oracle: div +38==+38, div_spaced +38==+38 (absorb correct),
    mult +15==+15 — ALL EXACT. Tomba 2 still reaches the FMV (no regression).
  - **Load double-count fix** (earlier today): psx_instr_base_cycles reverted to
    pure execute base (loads=1); memory.c owns the data-access wait-state.
  - Commits 9cec60a, 2b5ad88, 47bcfec, a3e8f28 (+ cyc_watch dedupe). NOT pushed.
  NEXT: (1) calibrate memory.c load wait-state (native +7 vs Beetle +5: flat +6 →
  ~4 + a ReadFudge term). (2) Apply per-instruction mode + muldiv stall to the BIOS
  emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp) + dirty interp → closes ruler #1's div-stall
  gap (still 30 vs 56). (3) GTE per-command cycles (same stall mechanism, gte.cpp
  table). (4) I-cache fetch. Each Δ-gated on the rulers, FMV-verified.

- **2026-06-26 (RULER #1 BUILT + load double-count bug found & fixed):** Built the
  game-independent BIOS-kernel cycle ruler the §3c "TOOLING NEXT" called for, and
  it immediately paid off. Details:
  - **New oracle-model doc `CYCLE_MODEL_BEETLE.md`** — transcribed the full R3000A
    cycle model verbatim from in-tree Beetle cpu.cpp (base +1/insn minus load-delay
    absorb; I-cache fetch +0 hit / +4 KSEG1 / +3+refill miss; ReadMemory loads
    scratchpad=0/region-wait+2, posted stores; mult 6-13 / div 36 stall-on-MFHI/LO;
    GTE per-command table). This is the calibration ground truth.
  - **cyc_watch double-fire FIXED** (debug_server.c): observe was called from BOTH
    the dispatcher (trace_dispatch) AND the function prologue (log_call_entry) at the
    same cycle → every dispatched entry double-recorded. Added (phys,cycle) dedupe.
    Real tooling bug (Rule 15); native deltas were corrupted before this.
  - **Per-block-leader cycle observe ADDED** (full_function_emitter.cpp →
    debug_server_cyc_observe, #ifndef PSX_NO_DEBUG_TOOLS so prod = zero overhead).
    Native previously observed only at FUNCTION ENTRIES; now it samples at EVERY
    compiled block leader, matching Beetle's before-every-instruction sample. This
    lets cyc_watch anchor ANY block-leader PC (interior loop tops, prologue exits) →
    a clean KNOWN-instruction region on both backends. Emitted at normalize_address()
    (runtime phys) so relocated-kernel anchors match.
  - **THE RULER:** BIOS kernel EvCB-search fn at guest 0x80001C5C (relocated ROM,
    identical in every PSX title). Region [0x80001C5C→0x80001CA4] (18-insn prologue,
    contains divu+mflo + 2 RAM loads, no MMIO/GTE). Both backends now record it.
  - **BUG FOUND — loads double-counted.** Native [c5c→ca4] = 34, fully decomposed:
    block c5c advance 20 (=14×1 + **2 loads×3**) + block c9c 2 + **memory.c +6×2 = 12**
    = 34. The Stage-2 #1a commit (2ef47bd) made psx_instr_base_cycles return 3 for
    loads (+2 data-access) WHILE memory.c's charge_main_ram_read already charged +6
    per main-RAM read — the load data-access cost was counted TWICE. The opaque
    0x80017FC4 window hid this because the load over-charge masked the entirely-
    unmodeled divu→mflo stall (~30 cyc Beetle, 0 native). **FIX:** reverted
    psx_instr_base_cycles to pure execute base (loads=1), per the header's own stated
    "data access charged separately in the memory path" contract. memory.c is the
    single address-keyed owner (like Beetle's ReadMemory). Regen BIOS+game, rebuild.
  - **RESULT:** native [c5c→ca4] 34→**30** (exact: 16+2+12), dead stable. Beetle 56
    steady (84 cold = I-cache line refill). FMV still streams (i_stat 0x8D, no
    regression). The remaining −26 gap is now HONEST and decomposed: native is
    missing the divu→mflo execute stall, and memory.c's flat +6/load needs Beetle
    calibration. NEXT: isolate those two components — the BIOS prologue combines
    div+loads in one block (leader anchors can't split them), so the principled next
    step is **ruler #2 (HW test ROM, Amidog)** for hand-crafted single-component
    isolation loops (div-only, load-only), per the user's "do both rulers /
    completeness not convenience" directive. Then Δ-gate each EXECUTE-latency
    component (mult/div, GTE) into psx_instr_base_cycles and CALIBRATE memory.c's
    wait-state per region. All on wt/tomba2-cycle-audit, uncommitted.

- **2026-06-26 (measure: Beetle cycle clock BUILT + VALIDATED):** Added absolute
  guest-cycle exposure to the Beetle oracle (MAIN checkout, additive diagnostic):
  beetle-psx/libretro.cpp accumulates per-frame `timestamp` (CPU->Run slice) into
  `beetle_total_guest_cycles` (+ reset on init) with `extern "C"
  beetle_core_get_guest_cycles()`; runtime/src/beetle_debug_server.c h_ping now
  reports `guest_cycles`. Rebuilt beetle static lib + psx-beetle. VALIDATED (Rule
  0): guest_cycles advances ~565,022 cyc/frame = real PSX rate (33.8688MHz/~59.94).
  Beetle needs the .CUE (not raw .bin). FIRST CROSS-CHECK: native psx_cycle_count
  rate = 565,470 cyc/frame vs Beetle 565,022 (within 0.08%) => gross cycle-rate
  parity confirmed; remaining drift is fine per-instruction-path (needs same-PC
  alignment). Main-checkout Beetle edits are UNCOMMITTED (additive; master has
  other prior uncommitted work — leave for user to manage).
  NEXT (aligned comparator): Beetle has get_registers (PC) but NO run-to/step/pause,
  so same-PC cycle comparison needs a "capture guest_cycles when guest reaches PC X"
  hook on BOTH servers (native has run_to_frame/step; Beetle needs a PC-watch). Then
  diff cycles@PC native vs Beetle to see the residual drift, and Stage-2 cost
  transcription verified against it.
- **2026-06-26 (P3 step 1 DONE — single-source cost seam, identity):** Created
  runtime/include/psx_instr_cost.h `psx_instr_base_cycles(insn)` (identity, 1/insn).
  Routed BOTH backends through it: interp (exec_delay_slot, dirty-dispatch loop,
  precise-slice) + recompiler (code_generator.cpp sums it per block + outside
  delay-slot clone, folding into the compile-time block charge). PROVEN behavior-
  preserving: regen byte-identical (full.c + dispatch.c diff = empty) and Tomba 2
  still streams the FMV (i_stat 0x8D). Commit b00b81f. Stage-2 now edits ONLY this
  one function. ACCURACY_BURNDOWN.md added (all-axes burndown; axis-5 peripherals,
  esp. SIO/controller hybrid-pad bug, flagged weakest), 09a5d45.
  NEXT (measure before Stage-2 costs — don't guess): build the native↔Beetle cycle
  comparator. Feasibility CONFIRMED: beetle_debug_server.c (in worktree) already
  exposes beetle_get_frame_count via the beetle glue — add a parallel
  beetle_get_guest_cycles. Sub-steps: (1) find mednafen's running master-cycle
  timestamp in beetle-psx/mednafen/psx (psx.cpp PSX_Update / the CPU
  pscpu_timestamp_t accumulator — note it's slice-relative, must accumulate to an
  absolute guest-cycle count); (2) add a C accessor through beetle_libretro.cpp +
  a `guest_cycles` debug command; (3) rebuild Beetle static lib + psx-beetle
  (slow: `cd beetle-psx && make platform=mingw_x86_64 STATIC_LINKING=1
  HAVE_LIGHTREC=0 -j8`); (4) comparator: native psx_cycle_count (already in
  freeze_check) vs Beetle guest_cycles at same-PC convergence. THEN transcribe
  Stage-2 costs (mult/div, GTE table, mem wait-states) one at a time, each verified
  by this comparator. Native cycle side already exists; Beetle side is the gap.
- **2026-06-26 (holistic cycle-model audit, post-P2):** Audited ALL cycle-charging
  sites for the dominant class (delay-slot undercount) + cost-model consistency:
  - GAME + OVERLAY emitter (code_generator.cpp `translate_basic_block`): FIXED in
    P2 (block_exec_cycles +1 for outside delay-slot clone). Overlay/alias path
    shares translate_basic_block → covered.
  - BIOS emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp): NO undercount — different model. It
    emits delay slots IN-LINE at their real address (charged by the owning block
    via block_cycles count to next leader) and defers the branch via
    psx_taken_/psx_delay_ flags, rather than emitting an uncounted clone. So the
    delay-slot-is-leader case charges correctly. No change needed.
  - INTERP (exec_one callers): charges psx_advance_cycles(1u) per instruction
    (3 sites). 
  => The cost MODEL is "1 cycle/instruction", duplicated in 3 places (interp hard
  1u; game emitter instruction_count; BIOS emitter leader-to-leader count). They
  agree (Stage-1 backend-equivalent) but are NOT a shared function and NOT HW-
  accurate (Stage-2). recompiler CAN include runtime headers (already includes
  ../../runtime/include/ws_backdrop_detect.h) → a shared psx_instr_base_cycles()
  header is feasible for P3.
  NEXT CORRECTNESS STEPS (deliberate, not tail-of-session):
  1. MEASURE FIRST (don't guess HW costs): native exposes psx_cycle_count already;
     build the Beetle half — add additive guest-cycle exposure to the Beetle oracle
     (main checkout beetle_debug_server.c) + a native-vs-Beetle cycle/first-
     divergence harness (find_divergence.py is STALE/DuckStation-era port 4371 —
     replace with a Beetle 4382 comparator). This is the holistic correctness
     instrument; it makes drift visible for ALL code/titles, FMV being one measure.
  2. P3 shared psx_instr_base_cycles() seam (identity first → byte-identical regen
     proof → then Stage-2 real R3000A costs calibrated against the measure).
  3. P6: regress other titles (breaking is OK per Rule -1; just know), delete
     Tomba2 overlay_native_block.
  COMMIT: f9d50d7 on wt/tomba2 (local, not pushed, not merged to master).
- **2026-06-26 (P2 DONE — Tomba 2 reaches the intro FMV):** Implemented the
  delay-slot cycle-ownership fix in code_generator.cpp (translate_basic_block):
  `block_exec_cycles = instruction_count + (exit branch sits AT end_addr with a
  delay slot outside the block ? 1 : 0)` — charges the always-executed delay-slot
  clone that was previously uncounted (the -8 undercount). Applied to BOTH the
  slice budget and the block cycle charge. Regen + build clean. RESULT: native
  progresses past the frame-1824 logo-delay loop; screen animates; i_stat shows
  CDROM+DMA+SIO active; screenshot = the lush jungle intro FMV. The multi-week
  logo stall is GONE via the faithful fix (no hack, overlay_native_block untouched
  for now). Mechanism was structurally confirmed (instruction_count excludes the
  outside delay-slot clone) before the change; end-to-end confirmed by FMV
  screenshot. NEXT: P3 (shared per-instruction cost fn + MMIO segmentation), P6
  validation (delete overlay_native_block; regress other titles), and Stage-2 HW
  cycle calibration vs Beetle/psx-spx (current model is 1 cycle/insn = backend-
  equivalent, NOT yet hardware-accurate). Apply the same delay-slot fix to the
  BIOS emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp) and overlay/alias paths.
- **2026-06-26 (earlier):** Diagnosis corrected (timing-faithfulness, not take-point).
  Directive persisted (CLAUDE.md Rule -1, memory, MEMORY.md banner). Precise
  slicing root-caused (mid-function clean-text resume not dispatchable) + ChatGPT-
  validated fix (all block leaders = CPS continuations) — PARKED default-off;
  `psx_game_is_function_entry` predicate + slice-trace diagnostics + env toggle
  `PSX_PRECISE_SLICE` left in tree (inert). −8 mechanism located in
  code_generator.cpp (delay-slot-is-leader undercount). Tree builds + boots clean.
  NEXT: P1 (cycle-audit) → P2 (delay-slot ownership fix).

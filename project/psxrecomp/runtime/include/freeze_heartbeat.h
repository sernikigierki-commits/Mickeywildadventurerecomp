/* freeze_heartbeat.h — observability infrastructure.
 *
 * Starts a background thread that snapshots runtime state to
 * `psx_freeze_heartbeat.json` every ~100 ms. Survives main-thread
 * freezes (Windows / SDL "Not Responding") because the writer thread
 * is independent of the main loop and the debug-server TCP path.
 *
 * Reader: any external process that reads the file. The file is
 * overwritten in place — no log growth, no CLAUDE.md §3 violation.
 *
 * Not a fix for anything. Pure observability so we can see what state
 * the runtime was in just before it stalled.

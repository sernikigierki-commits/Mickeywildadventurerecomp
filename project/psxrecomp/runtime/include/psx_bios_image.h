/* psx_bios_image.h — the linked recompiled BIOS describes itself.
 *
 * The generated <stem>_dispatch.c DEFINES these symbols; the runtime READS
 * them instead of hardcoding per-image constants (memory.c's old
 * KBLESS_RAM_LO/HI/ROM_OFF, bios_hle.c's old PSX_SHELL_ENTRY_PHYS /
 * KADDR_DELIVER_RET). Because the values are emitted next to the code they
 * describe — couriered verbatim from the BIOS profile by the emitter — they
 * cannot disagree with the linked BIOS. Same seam as psx_bios_kernel_bodies.
 *
 * A zero value means "this BIOS has no such thing" (no kernel-bless window,
 * no shell boot-skip entry, no DeliverEvent HLE return): consumers must treat
 * zero as structurally-unavailable, never as address 0.

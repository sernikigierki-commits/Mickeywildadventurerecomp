/* psx_bios_backend.h — the routing seam between the runtime and whichever
 * recompiled BIOS is active.
 *
 * Every build links more than one recompiled BIOS (bundled OpenBIOS plus a
 * retail image). Each one exports exactly ONE symbol — its backend descriptor,
 * named <STEM>_psx_bios_backend — and everything else it defines is either
 * static or stem-prefixed, so the images cannot collide at link time.
 *
 * The runtime picks a backend at startup (docs/BIOS_SELECTION.md: no explicit
 * player choice -> OpenBIOS; an explicit, identity-matching choice -> that
 * image) and publishes it as psx_bios_active.
 *
 * Callers do not go through this struct. The unprefixed psx_dispatch() /
 * psx_dispatch_call() the game's generated C and the runtime already call are
 * thin forwarders (psx_bios_backend.c) that route to the active backend, and
 * psx_bios_image is assigned from it at selection time — so adding a second
 * BIOS changed no call sites.
 *
 * Adding another BIOS later is one more descriptor and one more registry
 * entry; it is not another round of symbol collisions.

/* game_options.h — persist in-RAM game config globals across launches.
 *
 * Some PS1 games (e.g. Tomba!) keep their OPTION-screen settings only in a RAM
 * global that re-initialises to defaults every boot, with no memory-card config
 * block — so the player must re-set them each launch (issue #5). This module
 * persists a game-declared set of those globals to a small state file next to
 * the runtime exe: it restores them shortly after boot (once the game's own
 * config-init has run) and writes them back whenever they change.
 *
 * The fields are declared per-game in game.toml ([persist_options]); the
 * addresses are guest RAM addresses (KUSEG 0x80xxxxxx) of the canonical config
 * globals (pinned via consumer RE / option-screen write capture). Generic: any
 * game can list its own. Runtime-only, no debug server, works in release.

 * RESTORE-time validation: a saved value outside [vmin,vmax] is rejected (the
 * game default is used) so a corrupt/stale file can't inject an out-of-range
 * value. Pass [INT32_MIN, INT32_MAX] for a field that needs no validation.

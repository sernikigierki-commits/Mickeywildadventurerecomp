// cue_sheet.h — the single cue-sheet parser for the runtime.
//
// A .cue is the authoritative table of contents for a PS1 disc dump: it names
// the backing BINARY file(s) and the TRACK/INDEX layout (data track, CD-DA
// audio tracks, pregaps). Everything that needs to understand a cue goes
// through here so the mount path (iso_reader.cpp), the identity/verify path
// (disc_identity.cpp) and the picked-path resolver (disc_path.cpp) can never
// disagree about what a given cue describes.
//
// Parsing is deliberately permissive about surface syntax (case, quoting,
// leading whitespace) and strict about semantics: a FILE whose type is not
// BINARY is reported rather than guessed at, because WAVE/MP3 payloads have no
// fixed sector geometry and mis-mapping the TOC is worse than refusing the
// image.

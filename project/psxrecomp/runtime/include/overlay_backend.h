/* overlay_backend — compiler-NEUTRAL overlay tier-selection policy.
 *
 * This is NOT specific to any one producer. It decides which native overlay
 * tier fills a gap, in priority order:
 *
 *   static  >  gcc shard  >  tcc shard  >  interp
 *
 * - gcc:  spawn-gcc -> overlay DLL. The developer / production "holy grail"
 *         (best-optimized; the shards shipped in releases).
 * - tcc:  spawn-tcc -> overlay DLL. Bundled, toolchain-free user fallback that
 *         fills regions the shipped gcc cache misses on a machine without gcc.
 *
 * (The in-process sljit JIT tier was removed 2026-07-15 — it mis-compiled and
 * had been gated off since 2026-06-25. Uncovered gaps fall to the interpreter.)
 *
 * gcc and tcc go through the IDENTICAL pipeline (recompiler -> C -> compiler ->
 * DLL -> loader); they differ only in the compiler binary the autocompile
 * command runs. So both map to the same in-runtime "code provider" (the
 * autocompile spawn) — see code_provider.c — and which compiler runs is chosen
 * here by the resolved backend.

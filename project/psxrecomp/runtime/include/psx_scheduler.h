/* psx_scheduler.h — deterministic TCB cooperative-thread scheduler (carve-out).
 *
 * Replaces the non-deterministic host-fiber bridge (traps.c
 * psx_change_thread_fiber / psx_thread_fiber_entry, which maps each guest
 * thread to a Win32/ucontext fiber and overloads cpu->pc=0 as a host-control
 * signal) with a structured, deterministic scheduler that operates on the REAL
 * guest TCB structures.
 *
 * Rationale (see HLE_SCHEDULER_CARVEOUT_PLAN.md + CLAUDE.md §0 AMENDMENT): the
 * PS1 BIOS scheduler is pure-TCB — a thread's entire context (GPRs + guest SP +
 * EPC) lives in its TCB; a "thread switch" is just changing which TCB
 * dword_108->entry points to (ExceptionHandler 0xC80 / ReturnFromException
 * 0xF40, docs/psx_bios_disasm.txt). There is NO stack switch on real hardware,
 * so host fibers were never semantically required — they exist only because a
 * recompiled infinite-loop function never returns to its native caller. Because
 * guest control flow here is dispatch-based (tail-call trampoline + every-
 * block-leader re-entry), a thread switch can instead be a deterministic
 * unwind-to-scheduler + re-dispatch-the-target's-EPC.
 *
 * INVARIANT this design lives or dies on: guest thread context lives ONLY in
 * CPUState / RAM / the TCB reg array — NEVER in a host fiber stack, generated
 * C locals, a pc=0 sentinel, or a global resume PC. A yield/switch/RFE may
 * unwind the host stack ONLY after all guest-visible state is committed and the
 * resume PC is dispatchable, and only at a block-leader boundary.
 *
 * ── SCAFFOLDING (plan steps 1-2) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * This header + the matching definitions in traps.c are INERT: the host-fiber
 * bridge (psx_change_thread_fiber) is still authoritative. Later steps wire the
 * outer scheduler loop and structured escapes in to replace it.

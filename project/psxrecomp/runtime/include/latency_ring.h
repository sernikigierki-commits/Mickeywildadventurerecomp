/* Always-on input->photon latency ring.
 *
 * Every present cycle (one sdl_vblank_present call) stamps a QPC timestamp at
 * a few fixed stages.  The ring records continuously from process start so a
 * probe can QUERY a window of recent frames after the fact (never arm-then-
 * capture).  It is backend-agnostic: the GL and Vulkan present paths both mark
 * the same SWAP_BEGIN/SWAP_END boundary, so their latency is directly
 * comparable.  Query through the debug server ("latency" command).
 *
 * Single writer (the emu/vblank thread) marks; the debug-server IO thread reads
 * best-effort.  Timestamps are monotonic and a torn read only blurs one frame's
 * diagnostic, so no locking is used (matches the other always-on rings). */

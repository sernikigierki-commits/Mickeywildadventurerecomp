/* code_provider.h — the backend-agnostic code-production seam.
 *
 * One interface the overlay capture/dispatch spine talks to instead of calling
 * a specific backend directly. The validated gcc/tcc spawn->DLL->rescan path is
 * its implementation. Everything that makes overlays correct — content-keyed
 * multi-candidate dispatch, per-call live-byte validation, the self-mod
 * blacklist, the coverage manifest — is backend-blind.
 *
 * Production is BATCH / ASYNC (request / busy / poll_main): kicked by the
 * autocapture tick, spawns a compiler off-thread, applied later via a cache
 * rescan on the emu thread. Seconds of latency; many fragments per run. A
 * provider sets the hooks it supports and leaves the rest NULL; callers
 * null-check before invoking.
 *
 * (The in-process sljit JIT provider — a synchronous on-miss producer with a
 * compile_fragment hook — was removed 2026-07-15; it had been disabled by
 * default since 2026-06-25 due to an emitter bug. Gaps gcc/tcc have not yet
 * covered fall to the interpreter, the always-safe precision-over-recall floor.)

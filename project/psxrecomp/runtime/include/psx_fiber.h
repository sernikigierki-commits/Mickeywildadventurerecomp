/*
 * psx_fiber.h — cross-platform cooperative fibers for the BIOS thread
 * scheduler (traps.c) and exception-deferral (interrupts.c).
 *
 * The PS1 BIOS manages its own threads (TCBs) and switches between them
 * cooperatively; the runtime mirrors each BIOS thread with a host fiber so
 * the recompiled C for a suspended thread keeps its own native call stack
 * across a ChangeThread. The CD-boot handoff in particular depends on this:
 * a thread issues a CD command, WaitEvent-blocks, and the scheduler must be
 * able to resume a *different* thread's previously-suspended stack — which
 * requires real separate stacks, not nested dispatch.
 *
 * Backends:
 *   - Windows: the Win32 Fiber API (ConvertThreadToFiber / CreateFiber /
 *     SwitchToFiber / DeleteFiber). Behavior is identical to the original.
 *   - POSIX (macOS/Linux): ucontext (makecontext / swapcontext).
 *
 * Cooperative, single-threaded: exactly one fiber runs at a time and all
 * switches are explicit. psx_fiber_current() is the GetCurrentFiber analog.

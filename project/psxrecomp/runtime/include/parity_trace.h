/* parity_trace.h — general two-process control-flow parity trace.
 *
 * Purpose: end the "somewhere upstream" blindness. A thread/TCB-scoped,
 * freeze-on-trigger ring with an IDENTICAL struct + JSON wire format on BOTH
 * psx-runtime (code under test) and psx-beetle (independent oracle), so a
 * generic sequence-diff tool (tools/parity_diff.py) can locate the FIRST logical
 * divergence between the two timelines — not a frame diff (docs/internal/PRINCIPLES.md "find
 * the first divergence" + "is the value WRONG or is the behavior MISSING").
 *
 * Model (CLAUDE.md ring-buffer doctrine): armed from boot (so the pre-divergence
 * window is always covered — never arm-then-time), records one row per relevant
 * control event while current_tcb == watched_tcb (or all TCBs if watched==0),
 * and LATCHES (freezes) the moment a configured trigger target is dispatched, so
 * the lead-up to the wedge survives instead of being evicted by the wedge loop.
 *
 * Generality: point it at any watched TCB + freeze trigger + up to six watch-word
 * addresses. The MMX6 cutscene→gameplay freeze is the first user, but nothing
 * here is MMX6-specific — it is the reusable substrate for a functional-parity
 * audit between recomp and oracle.

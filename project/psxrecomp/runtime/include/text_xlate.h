/* text_xlate.h — on-the-fly string translation / localization (framework).
 *
 * A reusable psxrecomp feature: capture the game's source strings from guest
 * memory and substitute translated bytes on the fly so a JP-only title can be
 * played in the target language. See docs/STRING_TRANSLATION.md for the design.
 *
 * Mechanism (all always-on, hung off the psx_dispatch chokepoint):
 *  - CAPTURE: on every dispatch, scan the arg registers for pointers to source
 *    text records (encoding-profile validated). Every distinct record is hashed
 *    (FNV-1a64) and recorded into an in-memory inventory ring queryable over the
 *    TCP debug server (the "enumerate every string" authoring source). Never
 *    arm-then-run — the ring records from boot; the debug command queries it.
 *  - APPLY: when an arg points at a record present in the loaded translation
 *    table, transcode the target-language string to the game's glyph codes,
 *    write it into transient guest-stack scratch (below $sp), and repoint the
 *    arg register — the ORIGINAL draw routine then renders the replacement.
 *    KV-gated, so a stray pointer that isn't in the table is left untouched.
 *  - GLYPH-LABEL PATCH: UI text drawn glyph-by-glyph from a fixed-stride,
 *    space-padded EXE table (level/stage names) has no string pointer and no
 *    terminator, so the arg-scan hook can never see it. Instead each confirmed
 *    slot is patched in guest RAM once the EXE region is resident: verify the
 *    expected JP bytes are present, then overwrite exactly the slot width with
 *    target-language fullwidth Shift-JIS re-padded to that width. The game's own
 *    per-glyph routine then draws the translation. Fed by [[glyph_label]] TOML
 *    entries; gated on language; never spills past the confirmed slot bounds.
 *  - VRAM-STRIP PATCH: some UI text is PRE-RENDERED PIXELS in a texture asset
 *    (e.g. Tsumu's HUD labels live in the glyph-sheet image the game uploads to
 *    VRAM and samples with quads) — there are no glyph codes anywhere, so
 *    neither hook above can ever see it. Instead the patch rides the game's own
 *    upload: on completion of every CPU→VRAM image transfer (GP0 0xA0) any
 *    configured rect contained in the upload is verified against its expected
 *    JP pixels and, only on an exact match, rewritten with the target-language
 *    pixels through the same renderer write path (software/GL/supersample
 *    coherent). Re-applies automatically whenever the game re-uploads the
 *    asset — this is a source-path patch, not a one-shot VRAM poke. Fed by
 *    [[vram_patch]] TOML entries; gated on language; verify-before-patch.
 *
 * Encoding is abstracted behind an EncodingProfile (validator + terminator rules
 * + UTF-8 -> glyph transcoder) selected per title; Tsumu uses the shift_jis
 * profile. No generated-code edits, no regen: the hook is called from
 * fntrace_record (runtime source), so it works in Release.

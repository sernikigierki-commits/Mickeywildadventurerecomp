# Guard against build targets whose output files collide on a case-insensitive
# filesystem (Windows and macOS — two of the three platforms we document).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Until 2026-07-27 recompiler/CMakeLists.txt defined BOTH `psxrecomp` (the
# user-facing CLI, from src/main_cli.cpp) and `PSXRecomp` (a legacy duplicate of
# psxrecomp-game). CMake treats those as two distinct targets and links both
# happily, but on Windows they write to the SAME path on disk. Whichever linked
# last silently overwrote the other. The CLI lost, so the binary shipped as
# `psxrecomp.exe` in the released CLI package was actually the game recompiler,
# whose arguments match nothing in the README. Nothing failed, nothing warned,
# and it never reproduced on Linux — so it shipped for a long time.
#
# A rename alone would not prevent recurrence. This check does.
#
# Compares OUTPUT_NAME (falling back to the target name, which is what CMake
# uses when OUTPUT_NAME is unset) rather than the target name itself, because
# the on-disk filename is what actually collides — two differently-named targets
# can still be given the same OUTPUT_NAME.
#
# Usage: call at the END of a CMakeLists.txt, after all targets are declared.
#   include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../runtime/check_target_name_collisions.cmake)
